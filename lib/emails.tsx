    content: `Dear Ainosuke-sama,<br>

I know it has been a while since I last wrote to you, and I apologize for that. Aiichirou-sama has been keeping me very busy at home. At the moment, I am apprenticing with his two more senior secretaries so that I can learn more about the Diet. The work is very challenging, but I am learning a lot and I think it will be useful. <br>

I hope that you are doing well. It must be close to the end of the semester for you by now. I wish you the best of luck on all your exams and look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>

Sincerely,
Tadashi Kikuchi

School is a drag, and so are finals. America is strange this time of year. They started putting up Christmas decorations in October, isn’t that stupid? And it’s freezing cold all the time.<br>

There’s nowhere good to skate around here, not to mention no one good to skate with. I miss the pool. At least there’s no one around to tell me off for smoking except campus security, and even they don’t care as long as I do it outside. If you were here, you’d probably hide my lighter or something to try and stop me.<br>

I’m flying home for the holidays next Tuesday. I assume you’re picking me up at the airport?<br>

If you would like me to, of course I will make arrangements. I will have to ask Aiichirou-sama’s permission to take the morning off, but hopefully he won’t mind. It would make me very happy to be the one who collects you from the airport.<br>

I wouldn’t bother taking your lighter away because I know it’s pointless (and because I also remember the toaster incident and don’t wish to repeat it).  <br>

Mayumi-san and the others brought in the big Christmas tree for the entrance hall and decorated it yesterday. It looks nice, but I think everyone is looking forward to the new year even more. I’m glad you will be home for the holidays. They wouldn’t be the same without you.<br>

Sincerely,

I doubt any of them have noticed I’m gone, to be honest. It’s not like Father’s ever around, and the others are probably busy scheming. I’d rather see you than them. I’m sure you’ll be able to give the old man the slip. What does he even have you doing? <br>

Don’t bother trying to high road me about the toaster. It was your idea, remember? <br>

Please don’t say that. Home isn’t home without you here. You are very missed, especially by me.<br>

Aiichirou-sama’s senior secretaries handle most of his day-to-day affairs, so right now my main responsibilities are to drive him to meetings and to take messages when he isn’t available. Right now I am waiting in the car while he has lunch with one of his sponsors. <br>

I do remember that Christmas, but mostly because of your aunts yelling at each other afterward. Let’s hope this one passes more peacefully. <br>

Nothing would make me happier than to skate with you again. The pool is still empty, and of course I don’t mind sharing my skateboard. I even promise not to nag you about smoking.<br>

I’m grateful for the opportunity to assist Aiichirou-sama in any way, even if it just means chauffeuring him to and from the office. I’m doing this because I want to learn, so that I can be useful to you someday. Yes, perhaps as your secretary. I don’t see myself replacing Takamoto-san anytime soon. I’ve never met anyone so dedicated. If he happened to die on the job I don’t think his body would stop moving. <br>

I hope you’re at least getting some studying done. I don’t want to distract you from finals.<br>

Come on, Tadashi—you don’t have to talk like that about him when it’s just the two of us. I’m not your boss, you know? Not yet, anyway. And even if I was, I still wouldn’t want you to be that fake around me. There’s enough fake stuff in my life already.<br>

You don’t need to worry about my grades. I’m top of my class. You know Auntie Kimiko wouldn’t be happy with anything less. If anything I need a distraction. This time of year the dorm starts feeling like a prison. Everyone is so serious all the time. No one wants to have any fun. At this point talking about skating with you is the only interesting thing happening to me.

I apologize. It seems that I’ve offended you. <br>

Please understand that I am not always in a position to speak freely. While I may feel one way about your father as my superior and employer, my feelings regarding his treatment of you are another matter and make it very difficult to handle conversations like these gracefully. For the moment, that’s all I can say. I’m sorry.<br>

I didn’t mean to insinuate that you wouldn’t do well on your exams, either. You’re the smartest person I know. If talking to me like this helps alleviate the stress a little, I’m glad. <br>

I care about you, Ainosuke-sama. <br>

Of course. I’m sorry for bringing it up. I will try to be a little less formal, if that helps.<br>

I’ve been making some changes to my board in my spare time. I bought a new pair of trucks that are hollow inside, and with less weight you’ll be able to Ollie much higher when you try it. I don’t think it would be very good for racing downhill, but it’s nice for airing out of the pool. <br>

I don’t have much time to practice anymore, so I’m sure we’ll both be rusty. I went too long without working on my nightmare flips and lost them. Maybe you can help me get them back. You were always better at those kinds of tricks than me.<br>

There was a Casper slide I was practicing before I got sent away. I can’t wait to show you and see what you think.

Are you talking about the slide you were doing around the rim of the pool? I don’t know if I could balance like that without falling in, but I would love to watch you do it. <br>

You always come up with things I would never even think to try. My fundamentals are solid enough, but I don’t have the same imagination. It’s one of the things I always liked best about skating with you. <br>

I guess we’ll have plenty of time to practice while I’m home. My old man usually takes time off around the holidays, so hopefully you’ll get a break. I guess even if he doesn’t we can still sneak out to the old spot and skate after dark. It sucks that we’ll have to share one board, but I don’t think my aunties are going to let me out of their sight long enough for me to buy a new one. <br>

I guess I don’t care as long as we get to skate together. I’m pretty sure this is the longest I’ve ever gone without seeing you. It’s weird.<br>

I’m waiting in the car outside baggage claim. As a forewarning, your aunts have asked to see you as soon as we return to the house. I’m not certain what for, so you may want to prepare yourself.

  `<em>I have a surprise for you</em>, Tadashi typed out on his phone screen, and then thought better of it and deleted it from the body of the email. Knowing that a surprise was coming tended to defeat the purpose of it, anyway. Ainosuke didn’t typically love being surprised, but Tadashi was fairly certain that he would forgive him this time.<br>

The skateboard couldn’t have been the same as Ainosuke’s old one—he had built and tuned that one himself, and Tadashi didn’t have quite the same touch—but he had salvaged everything he could, and even made a few improvements. It sat in the backseat, adorned with a simple bow, waiting to meet its new master. Tadashi glanced at it in the rear-view mirror and smiled.<br>

He tapped send on the email and glanced up at the arrivals board. Ainosuke’s flight was still showing on time. He had probably touched down already.<br>

Tucking his phone into his pocket, Tadashi got out of the car and stood, waiting patiently, as he had been taught to in his years of service to the Shindo family. The next twenty minutes passed in anxious anticipation, and then he glimpsed a flash of familiar blue hair through the crowd of passengers filtering away from baggage claim.<br>

Ainosuke looked different from the last time Tadashi had seen him—a little taller, a little older, a little sharper around the edges. It was still unmistakably him, though, and Tadashi swallowed as he stepped out of the terminal and onto the sidewalk and strode toward the car with purpose.<br>

Tadashi bowed his head in deference. “Welcome back, Ai—” <br>

The rest of his sentence was knocked out of him as Ainosuke collided with him with the force of a speeding car, sending Tadashi stumbling backward into the side of the sedan. Tadashi blinked, taken aback, as Ainosuke wrapped his arms around him tightly.<br>

“...Ainosuke-sama?”<br>

Ainosuke squeezed tighter. “I missed you.”<br>

Tadashi’s face flushed hot. He took a moment to collect himself, and then returned the embrace. “Welcome home.”`.split(
    "<br>"
