    title: "LOVED WITH AN APPLE",
    author: delacroiix,
    ship: "Adam/Tadashi",
    paragraphs:
      ` The world was black and white before it became grey for Ainosuke. The proper and the unseemly. The allowed and the forbidden. Family and strangers. Himself and the rest of the world. Black, proper, allowed, and family were good for him. White, unseemly, forbidden, strangers, and the rest of the world were not. There was a circle traced around the boy. Everything would be alright as long as he stayed between its bounds, like a secret left in the hands of his loving aunts. The very same hands that traced those bounds.<br>
              But his Ainosuke always had a knack for testing boundaries. Always drawn to the other side of the line, desperate for a taste of the white, the unseemly, and the forbidden. Strangers and the rest of the world were all he wanted. He would take in whoever showed him a bit of it, a momentary peek into everything he couldn’t have. Tadashi thought he ought to loathe him. This was typical of rich kids, wanting things on a whim, just because they were out of their reach. <br>
“Come on, Tadashi!” his father called for him. <br>
              He shook off the tender sadness he felt for the boy. Tried to forget that he was never loved or cherished as all children should. Like he was. Tightening his grasp on the bag of apples, he ran after his father. Though his tone had been stern, his withered face smiled, and Tadashi almost forgot his worn shoes and the taste of the irregular ground of the orchard on the soles of his feet. They did not matter. There was no place for poverty and struggle here. <br>
              There was an apple orchard in the Shindo estate that did not quite belong. While the flowers in the gardens were regularly tended and trimmed to be kept in order, the apple trees were left to roam freely because they were at the back of the house. They were out of sight and unimportant. The masters could not be bothered to worry about the state of such a secluded place and the servants had too many duties to waste time on worthless apples. The orchard was forgotten and hence, ideal for a bit of privacy. Tadashi was precisely at the age where he was beginning to value privacy more and more and found this situation quite convenient.<br>
            Tadashi was rather protective of his paradise. Often he wondered if young master Ainosuke, the one wild card of the family, would show up and break his peace. Luckily for Tadashi, the mistresses had declared the orchard forbidden grounds. Unluckily, his Ainosuke was fond of the forbidden. One morning he found a strand of blue hair hidden between the leaves and the apples, perched like a colourful bird over the branches. It was a bothersome strand, potentially dangerous for the integrity of his beloved paradise. What would the mistresses do if they found Ainosuke wandering the orchard? Surely they would tear it down, just like they had torn Ainosuke down. They had done an excellent job: the boy was crying, his tiny nose wrinkled in an attempt to stop the tears.<br>
The mistresses were so different from any other adults Tadashi had known. His own father could be strict from time to time, but never unreasonable. Mr. Kikuchi wouldn’t make his child cry like this. If he was in Tadashi’s place, he would be kind to the young master, covering him in love and tenderness. On the other hand, his father had always taught him to obey the mistresses’ orders, so perhaps he ought to remind young Ainosuke of his place.<br>
“Young master,” Tadashi called from the roots of the tree, trying to imitate his father’s gentle sternness. “You cannot come here.”<br>
            The words came out harshly. Tadashi sounded almost like a bully, and this made young Ainosuke cry louder. The tears streaming down the boy’s face made Tadashi go soft and forget any orders, focusing instead on imagining the terrible memories that his scolding must have evoked. The poor child. Instinctively, Tadashi sought to relieve Ainosuke and hence, he climbed the tree to give the boy a much-deserved hug.<br>
“What happened?” he asked, like an older brother eager to avenge whatever offence Ainosuke might have suffered. Master Ainosuke opened his mouth and let out a cry. He then resumed his weeping, hanging unto Tadashi for dear life.<br>
“There, there,” Tadashi consoled him, sweating awkwardly at the memory of his opening salute and remembering all the poverty and struggle that were not supposed to exist in his paradise. “Everything is alright now. Just let it all out.”<br>
              Ainosuke convulsed with every cry and Tadashi once again saw him as the blue-feathered bird. Small, trembling between his arms, Ainosuke looked like a scared chick fearing the cat that hid in the great Shindo estate. He was helpless, dressed in the same clothes he had been wearing the night before. Tadashi vaguely remembered the talk in the servants’ quarters, laments and expressions of pity for the young master. He had misbehaved once again and was punished accordingly. Indeed, red stripes were still visible on his forearm, red on the blue of his plumage. An injured bird. He had to be handled with care.<br>
              The boy flinched when Tadashi’s skin touched his, the cool morning against the warm beatings of the previous night. Tadashi stroked them with care. With every caress, he felt Ainosuke flinch a little bit less, hide a bit deeper into the hollow of his chest until the orchard became a paradise again. No poverty, no struggle. They held each other for hours, the sanctity of heir peace only broken by Ainosuke’s growling stomach. He pushed Tadashi away, awkward and a bit flustered, thinking that there was shame in being hungry.<br>
“My aunts did not let me have dinner yesterday,” he mumbled. <br>
              Tadashi’s lips curved in a sad and angry smile.<br>
“Can you have breakfast today?” he asked, being well versed in the punishments of the mistresses.<br>
“I am not to eat today either.”<br>
              Fearing to scare the bird away, Tadashi contained himself. Anger had defeated sadness. If he did not feel the need to protect Ainosuke, he would break into the house and let the awful monsters inside taste a bit of their own medicine. But what would that make him but another monster? What difference would he make? He looked at the boy in front of him. His messy hair, so often tied down and beaten into obedience but still blue, blue like the sky and the boundless sea. His hand carelessly fell among the blue strands and Tadashi patted Ainosuke’s head. He felt the need to give this boy something different from the pain and the bitterness that were his daily bread. Thus, he reached for an apple and offered it to him.<br>
“You can always come here,” he said, substituting anger with kindness. “Only I take care of the apples, so no one will notice they are gone. You can eat them whenever you are hungry.”<br>
              Ainosuke was naturally hesitant, having too often mistaken a treat for a trick in disguise.<br>
“Take it,” Tadashi insisted. “They are tasty. Sweet.”<br>
“I like sweet things,” the boy answered. He accepted the apple rather unsurprisingly, for Ainosuke had only received sourness and liked to search for the things that were out of his reach. A sweet apple, and a servant boy. This was the beginning of their friendship, and it was born of kindness, as well as of prohibition.<br>
              Tadashi started to notice the young master more often. He looked for him through the window while his dad was embellishing the garden and listened for yells in the dead of night, wondering if he should leave another basket of apples in the orchard for his friend to find. Would Ainosuke go hungry that morning too? Would anger finally defeat kindness and the sense of loyalty he owed to his father? How he wished he could take Ainosuke’s hand and take him to the servant house. Serve him tea and the sweets he liked. Cherish, and yes, spoil him. Some spoilt children needed to be spoiled in the right way. So Tadashi gave his friend everything he wanted. He gave him sweets and tea and skating. Sometimes a stray thought would cross Tadashi’s mind like a shooting star and an evil voice would whisper into his ear that it was all a game for the young master. That Ainosuke was born to take, not to give. While Tadashi was putting his neck on the line, his friend was doing nothing. That the consequences would be too great for him to bear.<br>
That voice was partly right. If they were discovered, there would be consequences and Tadashi liked to think that punishment would be extreme for both of them. But what did they mind? Their friendship had been born from prohibition and only became stronger with every risk taken.   Besides, Ainosuke took risks too. He was, after all, quite eager to bend the rules in his favour. Some nights Tadashi went home to a tasty dessert that Ainosuke had snuck out for him. He also liked to blend in among the servants, sometimes even wearing Tadashi’s clothes for the purpose. This greatly bothered other servants, who turned a blind eye because they liked Tadashi and pitied the young master. They let themselves be convinced by poorly fabricated arguments.<br>
“They will never recognize him! The masters see clothes, not faces,” he told them.<br>
              Mr. Kikuchi, however, was not so easily convinced. On those occasions when he saw Tadashi wave Ainosuke over, he would severely reprimand his son. Or at least, his version of reprimanding.<br>
“He’s the young master,” Mr. Kikuchi would say. He used a soft and tender voice as if he was lulling him to sleep. “You know you are not supposed to treat him like that, much less let him join you in the garden. I know he’s your friend, but your work is yours, not his.”<br>
              So far, this song had worked to dissuade young Tadashi from unwanted behaviours. He was, like his father, good-natured and had never before in his life disobeyed an order. But he had already spent too much time with young Ainosuke, who had infected him with his rebellious spirit. So he did the unthinkable: he disobeyed. Mr. Kikuchi did not miss his son’s rebellion, yet couldn’t find it in him to punish him. He was not the mistresses. <br>
“Tadashi is a good boy,” he mumbled to himself. “He must have a good reason to cling to the boy. After all, we all know how his family is.”<br>
            Mr. Kikuchi had almost resolved to let the children continue their secret friendship when he observed a terrifying scene in the servants’ quarters. The young master was on the floor, tears in his eyes and blood on his knee. He had injured himself! Such was the fright that overcame him, such the terror for the Shindos’ retaliation. He didn’t know a man could feel so much terror in such a short span. What if he was fired! Where would he find work at his age? Horrible as it may sound, he even forgot to check on his own son. For the first and the last time in his life, Mr. Kikuchi yelled at Tadashi.<br>
“Hadn’t I told you this would happen!?” he blurted out, the softness that was typical of him gone. In a second, he became all rough edges and in his roughness, couldn’t realise the fear he was inspiring in his son, who had never seen him like this. “What were you thinking! You are the eldest; you are supposed to be the responsible one!”<br>
              Tadashi rapidly crumbled under the weight of his father’s accusations. It was just a wound, wasn’t it? Why would he yell at him for that? He had fallen too, why wasn’t he looking at his son’s wounds? He wept and wept and it was Mr. Kikuchi’s turn to be scared.<br>
“I-I’m sorry,” he cried. But the tears were all the bitterer because he didn’t feel sorry about the thing he was supposed to. “But I don’t regret it!” he yelled, now a bit angry.<br>
“Tadashi,” Mr Kikuchi murmured. The roughness now smoothed over, his heart ached for the servant boy. He raised a hand to pat his head as he always did.<br>
“Stop!” master Ainosuke yelled and he charged against Mr. Kikuchi like a noble warrior bound for the battlefield. It was, of course, a lost battle. After all, horses and spears stood little chance against stone walls and the child was too little to pose any real threat for Mr. Kikuchi.<br>
He fell backwards and grabbed his knee, suddenly remembering the pain. The anger was still there, though. He stared a hole into Mr. Kikuchi’s face, who recoiled at the sight of so much rage bottled up in so small a body. Ainosuke looked like a different person, his brow bent to its breaking point. His hair, once the colour of the sky now reminded him of the hottest flame. It was the kind of fire that was inescapable and made people become paralyzed rather than run from it. The kind that destroyed everything in its path. When Tadashi rushed to kneel beside Ainosuke, Mr. Kikuchi felt the impulse of stopping him, lest he became ablaze as well. But instead of turning into ash, Tadashi tamed the fire. It was almost magic. The young master’s anger faded, melted away by Tadashi’s tender concern. His face was again that of a sweet child that inspired love in everyone he met. Together, the two boys burned like logs on a hearth giving only warmth and light. They cleared Mr. Kikuchi’s doubts. What had he been trying to stop? Two children becoming friends? Had he ever seen his son smile like that?<br>
              Truth be told, he hadn’t, simply because the feeling of being quite insufferably happy was new to Tadashi. He had never before had someone stand up for him in the way Ainosuke had just done. Not even his own father. Mr. Kikuchi’s face contracted with the realisation and locked eyes with his son for a second. Tadashi rapidly turned back to Ainosuke, showering him with kind thoughts. He had underestimated him. It took love and courage to battle a fight you knew you would lose. Tadashi hadn’t thought that any of the Shindos were capable of this. They were too used to silver spoons and yet, this boy who was more his master than his friend; this little bird with his scratched knee and torn soul; this child who couldn’t stand up for himself had tried to protect Tadashi. Who could defeat that mighty soul? He was, however, rather relieved to see his father leave without a word. Mr. Kikuchi never brought up the matter again, and left them to their own devices. Tadashi noticed that he even took  care to warn the rest of the servants against getting in their way. Still, from time to time his eyes would become unfocused and his brow frowned lost in thought.<br>
Tadashi wondered whether he was scheming a way to tear up their friendship, and pitied his father for his vain struggles, knowing that any scheme would be fruitless. At that point, the boys were too changed. They were gradually losing themselves in each other and in the pastime they shared. Tadashi and skating, skating and Ainosuke, Ainosuke and Tadashi. They all grew together, intertwined like vines. Tadashi loved to entangle himself in Ainosuke, even if he knew it was not meant to last. When the young master grew up, they would be no more. But they had those moments. They had time.<br>
Time, however, could not be trusted with one’s happiness. It was a capricious companion that always left its friends with the unsavoury taste of insufficiency. Tadashi’s mouth fill with the flavour of running out of time when he first met Mr. Shindo. It was long after he became his secretary. He carelessly reported for a call to the main office one day, expecting to talk to the butler about some affair like he always did. And there he was. He looked a bit like Ainosuke, but any likeness was easily forgotten. Mr. Shindo’s air was completely different from Ainosuke’s or the mistresses’. He too had a voice that commanded order and obedience, typical of powerful people who were groomed for power. But his was also the voice of a god that knew everything. Tadashi shivered, his soul baring before this man that acted as if he owned him. In a moment he could learn everything. All his secrets. All the forbidden things.<br>
 “I have heard you are quite close to my son,” Mr. Shindo smiled.<br>
              The more he spoke, the more Tadashi realised how wrong he was about Mr. Shind. He was no god. What he was witnessing was the devil itself made flesh. All those times that he had fantasized about confronting the Shindos he had not imagined the kind of creature he would have to defeat. What chance did he stand? A look from Mr. Shindo made him feel like an ant, a useless rock on the way. Like nothing. He surrendered, his voice giving in to the internal struggle and cracking under pressure. Failure tasted bitter in his lips as he promised to keep an eye on Ainosuke.<br>
Still, he told himself, this isn’t an absolute loss. There has been no punishment and I can still save him from his family.<br>
           Once again, he was wrong. As his new assignment brought him closer to Mr. Shindo and farther away from Ainosuke, Tadashi discovered the depths of Mr. Shindo’s punishment. He was well informed about every little defiance, every act of rebellion. When Ainosuke escaped the estate to train on skating parks, Mr. Shindo was merely pretending to look the other way. In reality, even the police that chased down Ainosuke and his friends was in his pocket. He was also aware of the money that Ainosuke had substracted for the founding of “S” and paid hush money to the victims of Ainosuke’s brutal skating. Even Ainosuke’s pseudonym, Adam, was but a seed planted by Mr. Shindo’s religious lessons. A plot to give Ainosuke a false sense of rebellion. It had the added advantage of making Tadashi miserable for his false allegiance, as he was still Ainosuke’s confidant.<br>
“No one can get me now you see? I’m the best and all the skaters in “S” are beneath me. They are just animals, and me… Only I am human among all those beasts. I am like Adam in the garden of Eden. If only I was given an Eve to ease my burden…” he sighed.<br>
              What was Tadashi to do? He wanted to tell him everything and apologize for his cowardice. Often, he thought that if he truly cared for Ainosuke, he would stop being his friend so that Mr. Shindo would have one less eye on his son. He wouldn’t find himself protecting his friendship and not his friend. Instead, all he did was wish. Wish that he could offer himself as an Eve for Ainosuke, to ease the pain that he himself had helped to cause. Wish that Adam did not exist. It was a dirty stain painted by Mr. Shindo on his son’s soul that was driving him down the path of madness. It was because of Adam that Tadashi was losing Ainosuke to the skateboard that was supposed to set him free. <br>
“I’m sorry,” he whispered to himself after these conversations.<br>
    Guilt ate Tadashi away. He turned in his bed at night, wondering what he could have done differently. Nightmares plagued his dreams, the evil voice whispering in his mind once again, blaming him. One particularly bad night, he pondered whether Mr. Shindo’s punishment was inspired by the orchard apple Tadashi had gifted Ainosuke. After all, he was forbidden from entering the orchard. Maybe their friendship in itself was just a twisted trick to teach Ainosuke the many ways in which he ought to stay within the traced bounds. The thought made Tadashi shiver. To think that Mr. Shindo had been using him like a pawn, that he would toy thus with Ainosuke’s life. He was even worse than the mistresses and left Tadashi way more helpless. When he was a child, he fancied himself a saviour and perhaps deep inside, he had always thought that he could save Ainosuke. Now that their enemies had changed, Tadashi became certain that he was battling a losing war. His eyes filled with tears whenever he thought of young Ainosuke, trying to defeat a man twice his side for the sake of Tadashi. He was the hero. Tadashi was only a common man not worth the effort. There was nothing he could do for Ainosuke, except be by his side and watch him go down the path of destruction. Until the very end, the day Mr. Shindo put Adam to sleep.<br>
    The smoke tickled Tadashi’s eyes as he watched Ainosuke’s skateboard  burn down. Being familiar with Ainosuke’s mannerisms, he avoided looking at him for fear of himself. What would he do if he watched Ainosuke at the climax of his pain? Maybe he would strangle Mr. Shindo. Maybe he would throw himself at Ainosuke’s mercy and beg for forgiveness as he had often fantasized. Maybe he would confess everything. His feet unconsciously moved towards Ainosuke but they collided with the wall of Mr. Shindo’s eyes.<br>
 “Do you have something to say?” he asked Tadashi.<br>
              And really, what could he say? That he was making a mistake? That skating was good for Ainosuke? That everyone would get injured if he took that away? It was all true, and yet, people were already getting injured.<br>
              “No,” Tadashi answered and frightened as he was, he could not protect himself from Ainosuke’s eyes. They were full of disappointment, pain and betrayal. They were a spear through Tadashi’s heart that made him forget how to breathe and walk and forced him to stay put long after Ainosuke and Mr. Shindo had left. Even after he managed to move in the dead of night, Tadashi knew there was no cure. A part of him had died and forever, the resulting gangrene would kill him second by second.  Already he could feel the rotting spreading, as he walked to the servants’ quarters. His numb limbs didn’t react at the sight of Ainosuke, nor did they try to defend themselves when Tadashi was promptly lifted and slammed against the wall. Perhaps, a punch to the face would do the trick to wake him up. It could also help Ainosuke, as he was obviously elated with the idea of putting Tadashi in his place<br>
“How dare you do this to me!” Ainosuke howled.<br>
              Tadashi opened his mouth to say something, coming out empty-handed. Truly, he couldn’t know how he had dared. What a poor Eve he would make. His blessing had not made his life better.Foolish Mr. Shindo had thought that Adam would die when the punishment came to its climax. Though he was a monster, he didn’t understand that the creature he was creating was on a whole new level. Ainosuke’s face, his eye wild in anger and his fists opening to let Tadashi go, told him the curse was not  broken. Adam was still there.<br>
 “You are nothing to me,” Adam mumbled, his face twisted.<br>
              Of course, Ainosuke couldn’t know what Tadashi was thinking. Even if he did, his words were quite wrong. Tadashi was someone to Ainosuke. His snake: he had been the origin of Adam as they knew him. It had all started with Tadashi’s forbidden fruit. A single apple, a small skate was enough for Adam to be born, a corrupted version of the boy Tadashi loved. A blessing turned into poison. He could almost feel the taste in his mouth as he cried in his room. But he endured. For if Ainosuke had been poisoned, then he could only let that poison consume him too. He had failed to fight for his Ainosuke’s life, so the least he could do was die with him.<br>
              It was no easy job, filling his mouth with poison every day. But lately, it had become easier. The days Tadashi found a cushion under his head when he fell asleep on the office’s sofa, he thought his perseverance was finally bearing fruit. Perhaps soon, they would both eat that fruit together. Just like Eve shared the apple with Adam.

    paragraphs: `
     It isn’t a week of work without it for Hiromi—a period of stillness, devoid of the proof of life aside from flowers and Hiromi’s own slowed breathing. Flower shops are popular enough, sure—there’s always a couple, a secret admirer, someone with a sick friend, a wedding order, or just someone looking to liven up their house, after all. There’s always more traffic around holidays, it’s true, yet the period of deadness feels inescapable.<br />

Sometimes Hiromi takes time to hone his ikebana skills, experiment using his friends or an object of affection as a muse—he’d gifted a few to his manager even before his failed confession attempt—but today just seems to be one of those days. He leans back against the front counter of the flower shop, staring at the ceiling. He can’t bring himself to do anything, bored as he is.<br />

<em>If they weren’t so <strong>dense–</strong></em><br />

Hiromi scrunches up his eyebrows as the doorbell rings and the door briefly whooshes open.<br />

<em>That can’t be...Tadashi?</em><br />

<em>No, Kikuchi never visits this day of the week. This is <strong>when</strong> he usually does though…</em><br />

Tadashi Kikuchi has been a constant in Hiromi’s life as a flower shop employee for the past few years. He’s a regular who always comes on one of the same few days of the week, specifically during the dead hour. Each time it boggles Hiromi’s mind how Tadashi is able to calculate exactly <em>when</em> the dead period of the day will be; nevertheless, Hiromi is always there to take Tadashi’s orders, big or small—whether they be elaborate arrangements or just bouquets of red roses.<br />

These last few weeks of Tadashi’s visits have been different, though, starting with the aftermath of Adam’s tournament. Just before he’d gone to confess—after spending forever working up the courage—he’d learned his manager already has a partner. It broke his heart, but life goes on.<br />

Tadashi visited the flower shop as per usual, and like a blessing, a consolation from heaven, Tadashi had <em>considered</em> him. Historically, Tadashi made his order, paid, and left. No more, no less. No “good afternoon”, he never returned greetings, and he always had that blank expression. However, <em>this</em> time, when Tadashi came in asking for a bouquet, Tadashi had asked <em>him</em> to pick the arrangement.<br />

Hiromi could not help but be taken aback at the time, but he fulfilled this request regardless, cheeks tinged pink. He was <em>embarrassed</em>, of course. All these years, Tadashi had never acknowledged him as a person and never asked for his opinion. They’d never made any sort of <em>real</em> connection and <em>yet</em>... Maybe Tadashi had never cared about him, only coming into the shop because he needed to, but the meaning behind the arrangement would be Hiromi’s little secret anyways.<br />

Tadashi’s face was blank as always, but there was an unmistakable flame of life in his eyes that’d been but a dying spark before. That flame of life has only grown these past few weeks.<br />

Hiromi turns toward the doorway, already preparing his customer service smile.<br />

It’s a man a bit taller than Tadashi who crosses the threshold into the shop. His hair is a bright blue rather than black, and it’s slicked back as well. Like his hair, <em>his</em> suit is also a more vibrant blue, in contrast to the muted black of Tadashi’s suit.<br />

<em>Dumbass</em>, Hiromi curses himself.<br />

<em>What? Telling me you <strong>hoped</strong> it would be him?</em> he chastises his own heart. <em>Don’t forget there are people <strong>other</strong> than Tadashi that buy flowers. He’s not the only person to come when it’s dead.</em><br />

His next thoughts, however, are concerned with the man who’s walked in. He’s handsome, no doubt, with that sculpted jawline, those piercing crimson eyes. It doesn’t help that the light filtering through the windows strikes the man perfectly, accentuating his features. When the man flashes his charming smile at Hiromi upon approach, his heart skips a beat.<br />

This man is the opposite of Tadashi—so much so—in demeanor, in look, even by how he just shines, inherently. If Tadashi is reserved, then this man is the center of attention. Regardless of the difference, though, Hiromi is smitten all the same.<br />

He wants to wonder why that is, why two very different men in different suits can make his voice go weak, make his heart skip a beat, even at his first encounter with them, but his brain makes the connection instantly.<br />

<em>Manager energy.</em><br />

It's the "manager energy" as Reki put it once, after he’d seen how Hiromi acts around the manager of Dope Sketch.<br />

Sometimes, it’s about the suit, but usually it’s about that air of command they have. It’s about how they seem above him, perhaps even above humanity. Their very existence tells Hiromi that they make the rules—<em>they’re</em> in charge. There’s just something about them that is <em>inherently</em> domineering.<br />

Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, Hiromi wants to strangle that brat for calling him out.<br />

Luckily, the interaction is simple. He wills the customer service smile to stay on his face as he welcomes the blue haired man.<br />

The man flashes another smile as he requests a bouquet of assorted roses—red, white, and pink.<br />

Hiromi focuses only on fulfilling the request at first, but nervousness settles into his chest as the man’s eyes bear down on him.<br />

<em><strong>Don’t</strong> slip up. <strong>No</strong> mistakes.</em><br />

<em>You’ve done this a thousand times. <strong>Stop</strong> shaking.</em><br />

He has a hard time not glancing back at the man, staring. The last thing he wants to do is embarrass himself—let his heart turn him into the clumsy shoujo protagonist of a romance manga.<br />

Hiromi holds back a sigh of relief when he completes the bouquet. His hands were shaking a little along the way, his heart is racing, but he hasn’t made a single stupid mistake. The flower shop is deathly quiet aside from his and the man’s breathing as he holds out the bouquet of roses.<br />

“Your t-total is–” Hiromi clamps his mouth shut.<br />

That single stutter rises above his head, casting its shadow over him. It’s only a single slip up, a simple mistake, but it’s plain to see—easy to catch—in such an empty, quiet room. Hiromi’s heart plummets down.<br />

<em>Dumbass.</em><br />

Yet, almost like the mistake never occurred—or as if he could care less—the man in the suit hands over a large wad of bills, taking the bouquet from Hiromi’s hands with a smile.<br />

Hiromi’s been staring, motionless since the mistake, but he suddenly regains his awareness. “...Sir, I’m–”<br />

“Shh…” The man presses his pointer finger to his own lips, shushing Hiromi before he can say another word. He turns, striding towards the door.<br />

It’s then Hiromi’s lips part, his jaw falls somewhat slack, and a blush runs across his cheeks. He’s frozen once again as he stares at the back of the man, letting his eyes trail from his sensible shoes, up to the back of his head of that vibrant blue hair, then landing down by the hips. He would be lying if he said he <em>wasn’t</em> checking the man out from behind as he left.<br />

<em>His pants are...tight.</em><br />

The bell rings as the man pulls the door open; however, to Hiromi’s surprise, those eyes of crimson land on him once again. <em>I’ve been caught</em>, Hiromi realizes, breaking eye contact for a mere half second as the man smirks back at him.<br />

“Keep the change.” The man winks, causing Hiromi’s cheeks to redden. Then, the door shuts behind him, and only Hiromi is left in the store, staring at the exit.<br />

Somehow, the man in the suit seemed almost...pleased as he left.<br />

<em>Pleased? Pleased by what?</em><br />

After a few minutes of wondering about the man, staring at the place he left, thinking about that charming smile, Hiromi shakes his head. It takes a few good head shakes to clear his mind, to get him to stop staring.<br />

<em><strong>You’re</strong> wondering <strong>too much</strong> about a man you’ve just met.</em><br />

<em>You’ll probably never see him again anyways, Hiromi.</em><br />

It’s when Hiromi holds the wad of bills up and counts the yen he whispers to the flowers beside him, “He’s overpaid.”<br />

~<br />

<em><strong>Nostalgic</strong>, isn’t it?</em> Ainosuke sits in his study, holding a bouquet of assorted roses.<br />

It’s only been a few weeks since the day Ainosuke sat in his study like this, awaiting Tadashi’s request to enter. However, this time, <em>he’s</em> called Tadashi here for the surprise, and Ainosuke is the one with the flowers.<br />

Yes, in a rare moment of freedom, Ainosuke picked flowers for Tadashi by himself.<br />

A few weeks ago, when Tadashi presented Ainosuke the bouquet he’d picked out, Ainosuke had smiled at him.<br />

“Oh. These aren’t for <em>me.</em>”<br />

Tadashi had furrowed up his brows in confusion. “Then who are they for, master?”<br />

“Well I’m glad you asked.” Ainosuke peered deep into those eyes of his, studying them for a reaction. “They’re...for <em>you</em>, puppy.”<br />

<em>He’d thanked me formally after that,</em> Ainosuke recalls. <em>But you could see the <strong>look</strong> in his eyes.</em><br />

“Shut the door,” Ainosuke had commanded, smirking, and Tadashi did. “How do you really feel?”<br />

“I… I thank you, Master Ainosuke,” he answered. His expression was blank, but Ainosuke could see that look of softness in his eyes.<br />

“Yes, we’ve addressed that. But <em>how</em> do you feel about them?”<br />

“I… I feel that I am...gracious of the offer.”<br />

“Come here, puppy,” Ainosuke commanded. He had beckoned Tadashi behind his desk, beside his chair.<br />

“Yes, Master Ainosuke?”<br />

Ainosuke waved, beckoning him closer, to bend down. Then, once Tadashi had bent to him, he’d pressed two fingertips just under his chin, tilting it up. He leaned forward a bit so their faces were but inches apart. “How do you <em>really</em> feel?”<br />

“I… I think…”<br />

“<em>Go on,</em>” he coaxed, emphasizing each word.<br />

“I… I like them. I...like it.” The answer was simple, straightforward.<br />

It was the truth.<br />

At the time, Tadashi’s mouth had wavered for a moment when he answered, cracking his expressionless face. Whether he’d lost his ungodly control for a moment or he’d simply let it through on purpose didn’t matter; regardless, it had caused Ainosuke’s breath to hitch. <br />

“Good boy,” Ainosuke purred in response, smiling again. He pressed a kiss to Tadashi’s lips. <br />

Ainosuke’s heart races in anticipation. His thoughts are a mix of recalling that situation and fantasy. A certain feeling rises up into his chest and he can’t help but feel…<em>giddy</em>, waiting to present the flowers to Tadashi.<br />

<em>How will he react this time? What will we do?</em><br />

<em>What will he say?</em><br />

He can already imagine the smile on Tadashi’s face.<br />
~<br />

When the last couple leaves the flower shop, Hiromi waits. Once the sidewalk in front of the street is fairly empty and no one’s walked in again, he takes a breath in, leaving his post at the front desk.<br />

Hiromi scurries around the store like a fearful child who’s trying to finish a chore just before his parents arrive. Someone could walk in at any time, so he gathers different flowers around the store, going off of a vague plan of his creation.<br />

He moves to fetch a simple vase he'd hidden—one he'd bought with his own money—after placing the flowers on the front desk. The design of the vase is shades of brown layered in a horizontal wave pattern, from the bluest of the browns at the bottom to the reddest at the top.<br />

He glances over to the pile of flowers, to the vase, and back to the flowers again, ruminating for a second before he reaches for the first one.<br />

Hiromi freezes when the bell rings. He pulls his hand to his side as he turns towards the door, where a charming man saunters up to the desk.<br />

<em>Who–? <strong>Wait.</strong></em><br />

<em>It's…<strong>him</strong>,</em> Hiromi realizes, eyes widening. <br />

The customer service smile shoots to his face in an instant. "...How may I help you, sir?"<br />

<em>What's he doing back here?</em><br />

The man's smile falls into a disappointed frown. "Ainosuke."<br />

<em>Right. <strong>Right.</strong></em><br />

Interested after their initial meeting, Hiromi had researched the man on a whim, sure he knew him from somewhere.<br />

<em>He's that young politician.</em><br />

"Mr. Shindo, correct?"<br />

"I <em>insist</em> you call me Ainosuke," he drawls.<br />

Was that a hint of annoyance in his voice? No, the real question is why such a famous man would ask a nobody to call him by his given name in the first place.<br />

<em>That's not your place to pry.</em><br />

Hiromi stops himself from shaking his head to clear his thoughts, nodding instead. "How can I help you?"<br />

"Ainosuke."<br />

Hiromi resists the urge to sigh. "<em>Ainosuke</em>, sir."<br />
“<em>AinOSuKe</em>”.<br />

<em>Bit particular isn't he?</em><br />

"What do you have there?" Mr. Shindo—Ainosuke—asks, ignoring Hiromi’s question.<br />

Hiromi follows Ainosuke's eyes, glancing towards the vase and the flowers on the desk. "These?" he asks, placing a hand atop the vase.<br />

"Yes. What you have there, is it…?" he purses his lips, bringing a hand to his chin in contemplation. "Are you fulfilling an order?"<br />

"An order? No."<br />

"Oh?" Ainosuke's eyes light up as a smirk graces his face again.<br />

<em>Is he interested?</em><br />

"It's for me. I'm honing my ikebana skills while no one's around."<br />

"Well… <em>I'm</em> around."<br />

<em>Right.</em><br />

"How can I help you instead?" Hiromi asks, <em>again</em>, already moving to push the vase and flowers aside.<br />

"I would like to watch."<br />

It takes Hiromi a minute, eyebrows furrowed in confusion, before his eyes widen.<br />

"Really?" is what almost slips out, but his job has taught him better. "Yes, Ainosuke," he says instead, pulling the vase back in front of him.<br />

Hiromi would be lying if he said Ainosuke's attention didn't unnerve him, just like their last meeting. Regardless, he reaches for a yellow sunflower, placing it into the vase first. He follows it up with a cherry blossom stem, which arcs above the sunflower.<br />

As he takes his time arranging the flowers, Hiromi takes short glances at Ainosuke.<br />

What’s odd is he looks <em>genuinely </em>interested in flower arranging.<br />

Hiromi pauses for a moment. "I apologize if I'm overstepping, but why do you want to watch this?"<br />

Ainosuke laughs, and Hiromi can't deny how it warms his heart. "I've simply got nothing better to do."<br />

It's a lie, surely—one he’ll tell every visit for weeks to come. He’s a rich politician. He <em>must</em> have meetings to preside over, social gatherings to attend, and speeches to give, so why waste time <em>here</em>?<br />

"So, why <em>this</em> placement of the flowers," Ainosuke asks, pointing at the vase. "What sets the sunflower apart from that blue one arching higher up? Why are <em>they</em> tied together instead of with, say, the red rose? Is there any meaning to its type?"<br />

"Well…" Hiromi begins to explain. "You <em>can</em> rely on specific meanings, but I'm choosing to rely on how each is tiered and its color. Even how close the stems are."<br />

"What of the wisteria? What's the meaning of it being alone?"<br />

Most of the flowers are paired up. Even the green bud is close to the sunflower.<br />

<em>Why indeed?</em><br />

~<br />

There's just something about Ainosuke’s laugh.<br />

There's just something about Tadashi's smile.<br />

As the weeks go by, Hiromi feels like he's stumbled onto a sort of beauty rarely witnessed by others. <br />

~<br />

"<em>Sexy.</em>"<br />

Tadashi peppers soft, slow kisses up past Ainosuke's collarbone to the tip of his nose, in between singing Ainosuke's praises.<br />

"<em>Passionate.</em>"<br />

"Tadashi."<br />

Tadashi stops. "Yes, Master Ainosuke?"<br />

"You've been opening up to the man at the flower shop, have you?"<br />

It's a question so wildly off topic it causes Tadashi’s brows to furrow. Nevertheless, he breathes his answer against pink cheeks, "Yes, Master."<br />

<em>He doesn't <strong>sound</strong> disappointed, but…</em><br />

"If it displeases you, sir, I can stop. I know–"<br />

"It's okay, Tadashi. I'm not disappointed."<br />

Tadashi pulls back to stare into those crimson eyes, analyzing them for emotion, brows still scrunched up.<br />

There's a smile on Ainosuke's face. "How can I be <em>disappointed</em>? I probably have <em>him</em> to thank for your progress in opening up to me."<br />

"That's...partially true." Tadashi adds, "But I <em>have</em> been working at it for <em>you</em>."<br />

Ainosuke smiles a genuine smile then, and Tadashi refrains from raising an eyebrow. Not too long ago, the idea of Tadashi spending meaningful time with another man might have awakened Ainosuke's more...possessive tendencies; however, Ainosuke seems almost <em>happy, encouraging</em> of it.<br />

Ainosuke leans close to Tadashi, breathing deeply into his ear, "Tell me more about <em>him</em>."<br />

Tadashi suppresses a shudder, though a flush works its way onto his face regardless. "He's <em>thoughtful</em>. He's a good teacher…"<br />

"And?"<br />

He takes a deep breath before continuing, cheeks warming. "He’s sweet and...surprisingly <em>easy</em> to talk to."<br />

"Awww, puppy…" Ainosuke giggles, pressing a finger to one of Tadashi’s reddening cheeks. "You <em>like</em> the cute flower boy, do you?" he teases.<br />

<em>Ah, so that <strong>is</strong> it.</em> <br />

"He's very <em>attractive</em>..." Ainosuke purrs. "Do you like him? Do you fancy him?"<br />

Tadashi merely sends Ainosuke a knowing smirk. "Do <em>you</em>, Master Ainosuke?"<br />

There's a moment of silence, of stillness, before Ainosuke laughs loudly. "I <em>guess</em> I've been caught," he confesses, not even bothering to deny it.<br />

<em>I knew it.</em><br />

Tadashi knows where Ainosuke is at <em>all</em> times. <em>He</em> curates his schedule. <em>He</em> drives him around. It isn't as if Ainosuke hid it too well either. <br />

Ainosuke leans close, breathing hot air into Tadashi’s face. Heat goes straight to his cheeks.<br />

“What do you say we bring him into our little...arrangement, hm?”<br />

The idea is risky. There’s no telling how a third person will affect their relationship, how Mr. Higa will take being pulled deeper into their affairs, or even how much more damage control Tadashi will have to run.<br />

But Tadashi can’t say no—not to Ainosuke—and he can’t deny the positive impact Hiromi has on them both.<br />

“Yes, Master Ainosuke.” Tadashi smiles.<br />

If damage control must be run, then Tadashi will do it for Ainosuke.<br />

~<br />

Hiromi sighs before slipping his phone into his pocket. He rises from a chair at a small desk, discards his trash into the bin, and prepares his customer service smile as he nears the door.<br />

"Hrmgh!" comes a muffled shout from the other side.<br />

Hiromi stops abruptly as the door before him is shoved open.<br />

"Hiromi!"<br />

"U-uh, yes?!" A smile—a real, although exaggerated one—springs onto his face.<br />
<em>Stupid! Stupid! Stop acting all giddy and happy!</em><br />

<em>She's got a partner!</em><br />

"Something came for you," the flower shop manager continues, smiling as she stands in the doorway.<br />

Hiromi scrunches up his eyebrows. "Huh?"<br />

His manager holds out a heart shaped bundle, tied together with a thin ribbon, and Hiromi slowly reaches out to take it from her outstretched hands. He cradles the bundle with one arm until he gets back to the desk, then sets it down before untying the bow.<br />

"This is...for me?" Hiromi turns to his manager, skeptical.<br />

"That's what the delivery man said. Although..."<br />

Hiromi turns over a red heart-shaped card in his hands. The first side sports a very well painted symbol of a white rose and is addressed to "The Flower Boy" in English. Then, he glances back over to the heart shaped box.<br />

He barely has to lift the cover before the smell hits his nose.<br />

<em>Chocolate?</em><br />

"Who'd send me chocolate?"<br />

"A secret admirer?" his manager answers, before smirking. "<em>Maybe</em> it's that plain man in the suit who visits every week. His name was…Kikuchi? The delivery man looked a bit like him."<br />

Hiromi turns away in an attempt to hide his reddening cheeks.<br />

"Or <em>maybe</em>...it's that politician. The one with the vibrant blue hair and charming smile." She teases, winking, "They <em>both</em> have been coming by to talk to you often. Maybe one of them–"<br />

"T-that's enough!" Hiromi bursts, face red as the card in his hands. However, he realizes his mistake in an instant, immediately turning to his manager.<br />

"I-I apologize, ma'am! That was...out of line."<br />

<em>You may be something of friends, but you can't just do <strong>that</strong>! he chastises himself.<em><br />

"It won't happen again!" He bows to her.<br />

His manager only laughs. "I accept your apology, Hiromi."<br />

A surprised look jumps to Hiromi's face, but he finds himself sighing in relief as he straightens back up.<br />

It's here he remembers the card, flipping it over to the other side.<br />

"What does it say?"<br />

"It says…" He groans once he's read through it, "Who sends a card and chocolates for <em>that</em>?"<br />

"For what?"<br />

Hiromi fills his manager in, forcing himself to contain a sigh.<br />

Turns out, rather than a love letter, the card is a business request. It requests Hiromi's presence at a certain high class hotel diner "just after the sun sets" so he and—likely—the sender may discuss making the flower shop the Shindo estate's official florist.<br />

"Wow, that's amazing!" The manager puts a hand on Hiromi’s shoulder. "Looks like you have a chance to land something <em>big</em> for this little shop."<br />

She’s right. It’s truly an <em>amazing</em> opportunity, but there’s something Hiromi doesn’t understand.<br />

Why invite a regular employee instead of the manager?<br />

Maybe Ainosuke was impressed with Hiromi’s skills and assumed <em>he's</em> the manager?<br />
He doesn't know. <br />

~<br />

<em>I can't believe this is scheduled on my off day…</em><br />

Worse still, he has to miss skating S tonight, but he can’t quite complain. After all, his host <em>is</em> treating him to a fancy dinner.<br />

A hotel associate escorts Hiromi past a large room, filled with mostly empty fancy tables and chairs. Just a few couples and small families sit inside, dining, of course. Hiromi’s eyebrows scrunch up.<br />

<em>This <strong>can't</strong> be right.</em><br />

"Hey. Excuse me." He turns to his guide once they've entered an elevator. “I assumed we’d be dining in the dining hall tonight.”<br />

The associate presses a button, sending the elevator upwards. They sigh, “Mr. Shindo booked a private room for your...business.”<br />

<em>I guess he really <strong>is</strong> secretive…</em><br />

Next thing Hiromi knows, he’s stepped into a hotel room, door locking behind him.<br />

<em>What?</em><br />

He tentatively follows scattered rose petals across wine-red carpet, past the bathroom, past the king-sized bed, and out to a balcony.<br />

“Is this how Ainosuke conducts all his business?” Hiromi whispers, wondering aloud.<br />

<em>Wait. Why am I surprised?</em><br />

He sees Ainosuke first, and his breath catches in his throat.<br />

If he thought Ainosuke was handsome before, Hiromi can’t deny he looks almost <em>ethereal</em> illuminated by the full moon overhead. He’s unable to stop his expression from softening—to keep himself from smiling.<br />

Ainosuke waves, beckoning him to sit down. Hiromi obeys.<br />

There’s a click of a lighter. Suddenly, a candle in the middle of the table is lit, illuminating the figure of a third person.<br />

<em>Tadashi?</em><br />

The first puzzle piece clicks into place.<br />

<em>What did he say about his work?</em><br />

<em>A secretary of an estate, correct?</em><br />

The roses are on brand for Ainosuke, as is scheduling a private room, but is this merely how he conducts business? Hiromi thinks about the fanciness of the hotel, the balcony. His eyes shift over the edge.<br />

<em>An oceanic view… A dinner under the stars…</em><br />

<em>The chocolates? The card?</em><br />

An answer lies right at the tip of his tongue, enclosed in a thin wrapper of mystery. His eyes catch the vase in the middle of the table.<br />

The vase itself is midnight purple, patterned with painted white stars. It’s nothing too special, but the flowers? <br />

<em>White sunflowers. Pink roses and camellias. Three each.<br />

<em>Isn’t it the same arrangement I chose for Tadashi?</em><br />

The final puzzle piece clicks into place almost suddenly.<br />

<em>Oh. This has <strong>nothing</strong> to do with business, does it?</em><br />

Here waiting for him is an insanely hot, rich politician and his—also hot—secretary. <em>His own confession arrangement</em>, originally meant for the secretary, sits in the middle of the table.<br />

Hiromi is being <em>courted</em> by the rich heir and his secretary.<br />

<em>God.</em><br />

Hiromi resists the urge to cover his face as it begins to redden.<br />

<em>I really <strong>have</strong> become the protagonist of a romance manga…</em><br />

~<br />

Ainosuke’s lips curl into a pleased smirk. He’s got Tadashi and Hiromi wrapped around his pinky finger now.<br />

He winks. “I’m so glad you could make it, <em>flower boy.</em>”<br />

      `Ainosuke knows he’s not easy to get along with. He’s totally okay with that.<br />

He’s snotty, he’s rude, he’s stubborn, and spoiled; he acts out when things don’t go his way, he speaks before he thinks, and his instinctual answer to any critique is to spit an insult back. <br />

He’s the definition of a rich, spoiled brat, and he knows it. And he’s absolutely okay with that.<br />

<br>Of course, he is aware of the way he is perceived. It’s funny, because he also knows he doesn’t act like someone with self-awareness. A young boy with the ability to reflect on how he appears couldn’t possibly be so annoying and stupid as this, right?<br />

Maybe Ainosuke is an exception to the rule; maybe he’s that one odd out from the rest of the rational population. He’s got delusions of grandeur enough to know it - or maybe it's self-deprecation. He doesn’t know. <br />

He does, however, know why he acts like he does. It’s embarrassingly simple. <br />

Ainosuke is, as most people that live and breathe, an insecure bastard. <br />

And he’s entirely okay with that.<br />
<br />


The train of self-deprecating thoughts goes as follows: Ainsouke sees himself as a lost cause. He grew up like he did, and, as the heir of a wealthy family, he knows he can never coexist on the same plane as the average commoner. Therefore, there is little to no point in changing his attitude - he might just as well give off spoiled brat vibes, because that is what he is. Most rich people act like him, but in a more subtle way. At least Ainosuke can call them out on their hypocrisy, and know for a fact he is more true to himself than they can ever dream of.<br />

Turns out, though, that all teenagers share the same rebellious streak, no matter their financial and political status. Thus, Ainosuke sneaks out under the cover of night, a white hood covering his face from the pale moonlight that can expose his features, and skates away to join the bunch of random nobodies practicing tricks by the middle school down the block. He might never be able to blend in perfectly, but he might at least pretend to be one of them once in a while. <br />

Or so he thinks.<br />

Watching the teens of less wealthy families gather in a small, tight-knit community of skaters, a realization dawns on Ainosuke. He should have tried to improve his way of being when he could, because he truly cannot communicate with other people his age. Not in a way that is deemed nice or polite, anyway.<br />

So he covers his insecurities with a false bravado because he knows how to do that; banter, cocky lines, tentative and superficial friendships with the other teens who played at being pros in darkness come easy to him. He laughs at their stupid jokes, and they laugh at his in return; he accepts every silly challenge and flaunts his victories, or flips off whoever manages to best him. He avoids problems with this behaviour, because his rich boy aura and the hood pulled well down over his face screams son of some important fella, and not even the amateur skaters with egos bigger than themselves dare to fuck with him. Hell, people don’t dare to touch him - not even a friendly fist-bump or a familiar pat on the shoulder for a jump well done. <br />

It hurts him more than he’d dare to admit to himself, even with his superior skills of introspective thoughts; he wonders how it would feel to be touched by people in a friendly way, the touch being nothing more but another way of showing encouragement and happiness. <br />

These thoughts are even more apparent when he watches the duo that are something akin to leaders of their little band (though Ainsuke is giving them a run for their money on that position). It’s a pretty-boy with pink, long hair and piercings glinting silver in the moonlight; his tongue is sharp and his eyes are a brilliant gold, and his movements as he skates are graceful, like those of a cat. The other one is tall and lanky, with messy, green curls and the warmest smile Ainosuke has ever seen. It reminds him of the sunrays dancing in the crystals of the chandelier in his room, casting pretty, little rainbows across his bed in the mornings. He’s cute, in the clueless idiot kinda way, and seemingly the exact opposite of his friend.<br />

The two, Kaoru and Kojiro (heck, even their names match), are almost always together, and it irks Ainosuke for reasons he doesn’t understand. Maybe it’s their small touches, the way they casually link pinkies when sitting down to take a breather, the way they always seem to be in their own little bubble that no one is able to pop. Maybe it’s the way they share a water bottle, or the way they lean into each other when they talk in hushed voices.<br />

Or maybe it’s the way Kojiro’s eyes follow every of Kaoru’s moves - not in a possessive way, no. It’s a protective gaze, one that tells he’ll be the first at Kaoru’s side if any accidents were to happen, but there’s more to it. There’s an adoration there, one that can never possibly be put into any words Ainosuke knows. It’s as beautiful as it is terrifying, and Ainosuke can’t help but wish to feel the weight of Kojiro’s eyes at the back of his neck.<br />


<strong>i. </strong><br />i
He gets to experience Kojiro’s intense stare after all; not at the back of his neck, but straight at his face. <br />

It’s a stupid incident, really - Ainsouke is too excited to be out skating for the first time in almsot four days, and he drops down the rail too fast, too sloppy. He ends up tripping over his own feet, cursing as he feels the board slip away from the soles of his fancy designer sneakers. The fall is inevitable, shoulder first, and makes him hiss as he takes a moment to just lay on the cold concrete, eyes closed, waiting for the pain to dull a bit.<br />

The onlookers let out a sympathetic oooh and someone stops his board from rolling too far away, but no one makes a move towards him to check on him, to make sure he is okay. After all, he is Ainouske, no, he is <em>Adam</em>, the untouchable, invincible, superior. He made that name for himself here, and he takes pride in it, no matter how lonely he feels knowing no one will come to help him up. <br />

That’s when he feels Kojiro’s gaze heavy on his face, and it startles him enough to make him open his eyes. Indeed, instead of the dark sky, Ainsouke stares right up at Kojiro’s face twisted in concern, eyes staring right into Ainsouke’s soul. <br />

They stare at each other for a moment, and the oh shit of having his face visible hits Ainosuke a bit too late. If Kojiro recognises him from the television or the paper, though, he doesn’t show it. Instead, he simply heaves Ainosuke up, pulls him to his feet as if Ainosuke weighs little more than a rag doll. His touch is warm, even through the fabric of that stupid white hoodie, and the whole situation is accompanied by a collective murmur from the audience; no one has ever touched Adam like that, no one’s ever dared.<br />

Of course, once he’s back on his own two feet, balance regained, Ainosuke rips himself away from Kojiro’s grip and scoffs. <br />

If he takes just a split second too long to push Kojiro away, it’s only because he’s distracted by the feel of someone holding him in such an oddly protective way, and no one noticed it anyway. That’s what Ainsouke tells himself as he skates back home, at least. <br />


<strong>ii.</strong><br />
They become tentative friends. Tentative, because Ainosuke is too much of a coward to open up on anything past an extremely superficial level. Friends, becasue in the end, Ainsouke is only human; Kojiro’s presence is stupidly calming, and Kaoru is fun becasue of his wit and their silly banter. Being with them is easy, and they balance each other out in a way that fascinates Ainosuke. Hanging out with them on the beach easily becomes a part of Ainosuke’s routine disdain for authority and his family.<br />

“I’m going away for my granny's birthday,” Kojiro announces one evening as they sit on a random bench by the sea. Kaoru simply nods as if he already knew, and Ainosuke shrugs, because it doesn’t concern him - why would it?<br />

Kojiro doesn’t say anything more, and Kaoru takes charge of the conversation, telling them about some tech mogul half the world over that made some fancy discoveries in the field of robotics. Ainosuke doesn’t tune him out, but he doesn’t listen very actively either; Kaoru’s mind is like an unstoppable force that just has to run its course, and he seldom cares about his audience's engagement in the conversation. <br />

His mind drifts to Kojiro instead. The taller boy sits next to him, legs spread, elbows propped up on his knees. He has a water bottle in one hand, and in the other, a pack of those gross liquorice snacks Kaoru loves for some reason. Kojiro bumps their knees once in a while, as if he too is lost in thought; every time it happens, Ainsouke feels the electric current from the insignificant touch travel up his spine and heat his cheeks. <br />
When Kaoru finally shuts up to grab one of the snacks from Kojro’s bag and Kojiro taps on Ainosuke’s knee to get his attention, Ainsouke startles. All of his attention is on the long, pretty fingers carefully touching his knee. He finds himself surprised by the hest of the touch again, and in this surprise (or maybe in his cowardice), he shifts, pulling his knee away. He pretends not to notice how Kojiro’s smile falters, pretends not to notice how his own heart stutters at the idea of hurting Korjio somehow. <br />


After Kojiro leaves, Ainsouke texts him only once, and only because he can’t sleep. “Hope you have a good time,” it reads. Such a silly text, Ainosuke thinks, and his gaze wanders towards the open window. The rose bushes cast long, dark shadows in the moonlight. In a moment of stupid, poetic weakness, he thinks there is a beauty to the bushes like that, in the dark only disrupted by cold, unwelcoming light. The idea is so out of place in his mind that he scoffs at himself, and thinks that Kojiro would likely appreciate such a lyrical observation. For a moment, Ainsouke considers sending another message, to tell Kojiro about the roses - but his phone buzzes with an incoming text. <br />

It’s Kojiro’s answer, a silly emoticon of a puppy with a heart in its mouth.<br />

Ainsouke scoffs, and throws his phone across the room. The puppy emoticon doesn’t have to witness his smile.<br />

<strong>iii.</strong><br />
One evening, Kojiro is the only one to show up at their usual meeting spot. Kaoru caught some stomach bug, apparently, and Ainsouke briefly wonders how Kojiro hasn’t caught it too - after all, Kojiro and Kaoru are all in each other's space most of the time. He doesn’t say it out loud, though. He doesn’t say anything at all, really. Being there without Kaoru and their banter as a buffer is weird, and it makes Ainsouke very cautious of their proximity. <br />

The silence between them is obvious, but not uncomfortable. They make their way down to the skate park in silence, and don’t speak much while they wait their turn either. Several times Ainsouke wonders what he can say, what joke he can crack, and every single time he comes to the conclusion that the silence is actually not bad enough for him to break. <br />

So he doesn’t. Instead he focuses on the skaters, and becomes captivated yet again by the way Kojiro moves - bravely, without any fear, taking risks, and making the highest jumps. He seems so sure of what he’s doing, always knowing the skateboard will be there to carry him as he lands yet another stupidly hard jump. Ainsouke wonders how he can pull those off but still trip over a simple ollie, and he says as much, finally cutting through the awkward air between them" or similar. <br />

“You make me want to get better,” Kojiro simply answers, the first words he’s spoken since they arrived at the park, before his attention wanders toward the next skater in line. Ainosuke stares at him, baffled. How can he say something so meaningful and important so easily? How can he utter these words as if it was your everyday greeting with the neighbor, as if it was as simple as saying “yes please” to receive a bag at the grocery store, as if they were discussing the weather? <br />

The words twirl in his mind, mixing themselves with the image of Kojiro and his soft, safe smile, and his awkward posture. How can he, a lanky teenager with no wisdom or knowledge of the world, say stuff like that without a stutter? Ainosuke has no idea.<br />

He beats his personal trick record that evening. Kojiro swoops him up in a hug in congratulations, and Ainosuke pretends not to notice that his heart skips a beat. He almost stutters when he tells Kojiro to fuck off as he pushes him away half-heartedly, and brushes it off as if his flushed face is only due to post-skate exertion. <br />

<strong>iv.</strong><br />

When Aisnouke finds out he’s being shipped off to America for college, he decides not to tell anyone. One day he’ll just disappear, and no one will know where he went. No one will miss him, and he’ll miss no one - no one at all. <br />

He skates just fine that evening, but his mood is down. He tells Kaoru to fuck off when he asks if Ainsouke is okay, and Kaoru flips him off as an answer. That’s fine, that’s normal, and that’s how they roll - no deep shit, only the sharp edges of inflated egos. Kojiro, though, is different; he watches Ainosuke closely, with a gaze that reminds him of the first time they interacted properly. It is unnerving, but it also makes his heart skip a beat. He wants to snap at Kojiro, tell him to stop looking at him <em>like that</em>, but can’t bring himself to do it. There’s always a softness, a vulnerability, an honesty in Kojiro’s entire being, one that Ainosuke can never bring himself to exploit or use in any way.<br />

They’re waiting their turn again after Ainsouke finishes another round of successful of rather apathetic tricks when Kojiro grabs him by the elbow and tells Kaoru they'll be getting drinks. Ainosuke is so distracted and surprised by the sudden touch and the unexpected declaration that he doesn’t have time to process that Kojiro is pulling him away from the group, and that Kaoru is yelling something about peach iced tea.<br />

They don’t hurry, they don’t talk. They just walk slowly, Ainsouke’s gaze pointedly following the cracked lines of the pavement, his elbow still remembering the sensation of that warm, big hand. He wishes for the touch back, it makes him feel safe and cared for, but he can never utter those words and wishes he could make Kojiro comprehend how he makes Ainosuke’s heart stutter. <br />

Kojiro’s gaze is burning at Ainsouke’s neck, and, not for the first time, Ainosuke wishes Kojiro wasn’t as smart as he is. He wishes Kojiro had some flaws, some annoying habits that Ainouske could pick at. He wishes Kojiro could do something, <em>anything</em>, that would give Ainosuke a reason to flip him off. Kojro doesn’t, though - he never does, because he’s too soft and welcoming, and too perfect in every way Ainosuke isn’t. Some might call Kojiro naive, but they’re wrong, they’re focusing on the surface, too superficial to look past the puppy eyes and soft, green curls. Kojiro is all the good things people wish they could be - he is the safety everyone dreams of, the warm light people gravitate towards on instinct, the sprinkle of true altruism that is impossible to achieve. <br />

Ainsouke will never be able to voice his feelings, nor to even name them in his deepest thoughts - so he crumples his yearning into a tight, little ball and stuffs it into the furthest corner of his conscious mind. <br />

They walk in silence, their arms brushing once in a while; Kojiro’s unsaid words about the reason they’re here and not back with Kaoru and the others hanging heavily between them, and Ainosuke self-deprecation regarding his cowardice weighing on his shoulders. <br />

“You’re leaving soon, aren’t you.” It’s not a question - it’s a statement, and Ainosuke isn’t even surprised that Kojiro knows. The straightforwardness of it is nice too, though not a typical trait of his; he must have seen this coming a long way, Ainosuke thinks, and nods in answer. They stop - the beach is behind Kojiro, and the air smells like salt and seaweed. Ainosuke is suddenly aware of how close they’re standing - he can hear the sound of Kojiro breathing over the subtle roll of waves behind them, and the thud of his own heart in Ainsouke’s ears. He has to look up to meet Kojiro’s eyes, and then even further up to look away; he has to focus on something else besides that earnest gaze. His eyes fall on the moon, hung up in the dark night sky, crooked and imperfect and almost-but-not-yet full. <br />

“You should tell Kaoru,” Kojiro says, pulling Ainosuke’s attention back. He sits down on the bricked fence that separates the sidewalk and the beach, and like this, they’re almost the same height. Ainosuke has to stop himself from meeting Kojiro’s eyes, in fear that he’ll look straight into his soul. Instead, he focuses on the way the pale moonlight turns those green curls silver, how it casts soft shadows across his freckled cheeks, how his lashes are long (so long!) and flutter closed when a breeze rustles in the leaves. <br />

He’s beautiful like this, all smart and wise and always so helpful, puppy behavior and lanky limbs be damned. Ainsouke feels the urge to kiss him, right here, right now. It’s a feeling he’s had before, but one he’s repressed, time after time, because he’s still got <em>standards</em>, and it’s not like he’s gonna exchange spit with some random guy he skates with. <br />

Their eyes meet because Ainouske’s body is a traitor ready to expose his human urges, and he was right - Kojiro looks right through him, his gaze is soft and kind, and something shatters in Ainosuke. He won’t admit to it, so he stares back, competitive against Kojio’s challenge. <br />

The moon shines over them, crooked and not perfectly full, and Ainosuke thinks <em>fuck it</em>, he’s leaving soon anyway. Leaning into someone's personal space has never been easier, not when Kojro’s so welcoming, so warm, and so safe.<br />




<strong>v.</strong><br />
They meet again, all those years later. Kojiro’s grown into himself, Ainosuke notes, and his personality has grown, too. Gone is the uncertain, lanky puppy boy, gone is the soft tone and even softer smiles. He’s loud, he’s obnoxious, and full of bravado that Ainsouke knows isn’t fake like his own. Their eyes meet from across the S crowd, and Ainsouke feels naked under it, as if Kojiro managed to see right through him. Even now, he remembers that first kiss, remembers the imperfect, not quite round mood up above them.<br />

The moon tonight is barely a thin, curved line, one that would cast no light if the lights suddenly went out.<br />

It's okay. They’ve got time.<br />

<strong>i.</strong><br />
At sixteen, Kaoru thought he knew his home like the back of his hand. He’d grown up here, after all, had spent most of his youth navigating its streets. Yet Ainosuke seemed determined to prove him wrong. In the year since they’d first met (and fought), his mysterious friend had taken him to every nook and cranny in town.<br />
It was amazing just how many places you could skate in, if you were determined. Like, right now, he was sitting in a brand-new development area, a couple of acres filled with half-finished model homes and empty pools. Cranes and trucks dotted the landscape and bars of metal jutted out precariously in piles. All in all, a dangerous place to explore in the day.<br />
And an exciting one to navigate at night.<br />
Kaoru leaned against a wall, wiping the sweat from his brow. His long hair stuck to his neck like a scarf. He was used to this feeling of exhaustion; skating with Ainosuke and Kojiro was like a race to the bottom. Neither of them knew when to take a break. They’d been here since sundown and only now could Kaoru admit his legs felt like jelly.<br />
His companions felt otherwise. Kaoru sighed as he watched them dart past, neither of them showing any signs of letting up.<br />
With a cocky smirk, Kojiro taunted, “Tired already?”<br />
“Some of us aren’t monsters,” Kaoru retorted, rolling his eyes. He didn’t bother to move, only watched as Kojiro shot off the lip of the pool nearby.<br />
“And you aren’t?” Ainosuke questioned. He jumped off his skateboard and flipped it into his hand. “You keep up with us most nights.”<br />
Kaoru watched Ainosuke from the corner of his eye. They’d both grown taller in the past few months, with Ainosuke just barely gaining an advantage. In his usual hoodie and jeans, he looked all limbs, like his body hadn’t kept up with his growth spurt. He appeared awkward on land, in a way he never did on his skateboard.<br />
It was an oddly reassuring thing. Ainosuke always seemed to be one step ahead of him, whether it was skateboarding or life, and puberty gave them an equal playing field.<br />
Unfortunately, that field didn’t apply to Kojiro who sprouted like a tree.<br />
“And it’s tiring all nights,” Kaoru finally replied, taking a deep breath as he centered himself. It was hard to tear his eyes away from his friend. “How do you keep finding them?”<br />
Ainosuke cocked his head, his messy hair covering his right eye. He leaned against the wall too, so close Kaoru could feel his heat. “Finding what?”<br />
“These places.” Kaoru gestured at the space in front of him. “You show a different one every week.”<br />
“That…” Ainosuke’s expression darkened. They’d hung out long enough that Kaoru recognized it for what it was: something to do with his family. Ainosuke glanced across the pool, to where Tadashi watched them silently. There was a secret language to their gaze, to the minute changes in their body. A sign of familiarity, of an Ainosuke Kaoru didn’t know.<br />
He didn’t like it.<br />
Ainosuke chuckled half-heartedly, as though remembering something. “I’m good at hiding.”<br />
Kaoru glanced at him, then straight ahead. “I suppose so.”<br />
Ainosuke hid his family from them. He hid them from his family. He hid behind so many lies and secrets, it was hard to tell just what parts of him were genuine. The only time it all fell away was when they skated, when there was nothing but speed and rubber and the thrill of the chase.<br />
Ainosuke’s smiles then were honest.<br />
Of that, Kaoru was certain.<br />
“What’re you talking about?” Kojiro asked as he climbed out of the empty pool. His eyes met Kaoru’s. There was something heavy about his lingering stare. Kaoru could feel the weight of it, even if he couldn’t understand why. Electricity hung in the air.<br />
“How much you suck,” Kaoru lied reflexively, looking away first.<br />
“Ouch.” Kojiro laughed, the insult rolling off him like water on a duck. It always did; Kaoru was half-convinced nothing could dampen his spirit. “And everyone at school calls you a gentleman.”<br />
“I dunno.” Ainosuke leaned closer, his breath warming Kaoru’s ear. Kaoru could feel every word more than hear them. “I think you’re right.”<br />
Kaoru flinched, his skin burning at the sudden proximity. Judging by Ainosuke’s mischievous grin, he’d provoked that response on purpose, the bastard.<br />
“Hey! I heard that!” Kojiro retorted, scowling.<br />
“Maybe I wanted you to hear?” Ainosuke drawled, chuckling. His eyes were bright and he was still far too close. Kaoru resisted the urge to recoil when their shoulders bumped.<br />
“I’m the only good guy here,” Kojiro moaned.  “And here I was about to tell you about a good spot.”<br />
That immediately caught Ainosuke’s attention. He straightened. “Oh? Where?”<br />
“Should I tell you?” Kojiro scowled, but even Kaoru could see that he was already thrumming with excitement, that his grumpiness was just an act.<br />
They didn’t even need to coax him before he’d already spun around, skating around the corner of the house and down the empty street. Ainosuke nipped at his heels but Kaoru kept behind, watching their backs as he followed them. It was an odd feeling to skate down a neighbourhood that consisted only of streetlights, the roads set in place before the houses.  It was an odder feeling to see the pair before him and see the space they kept for him even as they raced ahead.<br />
“Here!” Kojiro pulled to a stop at a dug-up lot. Wooden boards and metal pipes criss-crossed the hole and a single staircase led down to a yet-to-be-made basement.<br />
It was highly dangerous.<br />
It was highly exciting. Kaoru didn’t have to look to know the expressions his friends had as they gazed upon their new playground. Neither moved, as though waiting for a signal.<br />
“Scared?” Kojiro taunted, punching Ainosuke lightly on the shoulder.<br />
“Says the one who’s shivering,” Ainosuke retorted, shoving him back.<br />
Kaoru tuned out their daily fight. If they were lucky, one of them would be able to make it across to the other side of the pit. All three? Nearly impossible.<br />
He skated forward. “I’ll go first.”<br />
There was something about being with them that made him want to try the impossible.<br />
<strong>ii.</strong><br />
In high school, Kojiro had thought of love as a light, fluffy thing. His sister’s romance novels, his girlfriends’ romance chick flicks, even his own experiences told him so. Love was fun. Love was exciting.<br />
Love was heavy if you were an adult. Now in his twenties, Kojiro only found love at the bottom of a bottle.<br />
And that was only when Kaoru let himself drink.<br />
Kojiro tried not to sigh as he popped the cork of a cheap red and poured it into a wine glass. His reflection came back hazy and indistinct, and somehow that was more accurate than any mirror he’d looked into lately.<br />
“You’ve gotten better,” Kaoru commented idly, taking a bite out of his pasta. “I almost can’t believe you used to burn the noodles.”<br />
“That was once and we were ten,” Kojiro huffed, though he tried to keep the bite out of his voice. It was rare enough that Kaoru came to him instead of the other way around and he didn’t want to chase him away. Especially not when he was sitting at the bar instead of a table. This close, their knees almost touched; this close, Kojiro could pretend they were normal lovers as opposed to the complicated mess left behind.<br />
“I wonder what those girls would say if they heard that…” Kaoru wrapped a delicate hand around his glass. There was something graceful about the way he raised the wine, about the way he drank it. Only a small droplet escaped his lips before a pink tongue nimbly caught it.<br />
Kojiro jerked his head away. It was too early in dinner to have those thoughts. He didn’t even know why Kaoru was here yet. “Don’t you want it to be a secret? Just between us?”<br />
“We have enough of those.” Kaoru gently swirled his wine. “I probably shouldn’t drink this.”<br />
“Why?” Even as he asked, Kojiro could guess the answer.<br />
“I’m the only one who gets drunk.” Kaoru scowled. “You can really hold your liquor.”<br />
<em>Bingo</em>. Kojiro chuckled mirthlessly. “I have to be.”<br />
“Have to?” Kaoru raised a brow before a look of understanding crossed his face. “Your girlfriends.”<br />
<em>No, it’s the only way you’ll actually talk</em>. Just what would Kaoru’s expression be if Kojiro had said that? Surprised? Irritated? There’d definitely be a dose of denial.<br />
“Why, jealous?” Kojiro drawled instead.<br />
Kaoru snorted. “As if.”<br />
The answer was never <em>yes</em>, no matter how many times they’d done this song and dance. Kojiro gulped his wine carelessly. In high school, love was easy. Even the awkward intimacy of their youth had been as natural as breathing, the way they had explored each other without fear. As an adult, it felt like he was walking on broken glass.<br />
“I’ve got a reputation to maintain,” Kojiro finally replied, trying to keep his tone light.<br />
“A worthless one.” Kaoru set down his glass and glanced out the window. It was a moonless night, the streetlights just barely illuminating the nearby shops. The odd car sped down the street, its headlights glowing like beacons in the dark. Quietly, he murmured, “He’s back.”<br />
There was no need to ask who. There was only ever one <em>he</em>, only ever one reason that Kaoru came here to drink. Kojiro contemplated that he didn’t have enough wine to handle this and poured himself another glass. “I didn’t hear anything.”<br />
“He’s not in the city. He’s just back in Japan.” There was rage and there was grief, and Kaoru always seemed to teeter between the two, as though he hadn’t quite figured out his own feelings. Maybe he hadn’t. As smart as he was, Kaoru was an idiot when it came to himself.<br />
Not that he was any better. Kojiro had mostly sorted out his feelings to his old flame, but that didn’t stop the love and hate coiling in his gut at the news.<br />
In high school, they had been fearless. Growing up meant learning what it meant to be scared.<br />
And their shared fear was loss.<br />
Even now, it was easy to feel Ainosuke’s space, even in these quiet dinners between the two of them. There was the empty seat on Kaoru’s right, the one he kept no matter where he sat in the shop. There was the longing and loathing in Kaoru’s voice whenever he got drunk enough to reminisce. There was the skateboard that chased Ainosuke’s ghost across the streets as though if they went fast enough, they could stop him from leaving for America all those years ago.<br />
Ainosuke’s fingerprints were everywhere.<br />
And Kojiro was tired of it. “Does it matter?”<br />
Kaoru bristled. “What do you mean <em>does it matter—</em>”<br />
“He’s not Ainosuke,” Kojiro interrupted, the <em>our</em> left unsaid. At this point, he couldn’t even imagine kissing the politician their ex had become, let alone loving him. “He was never that cruel.”<br />
“Maybe he was hiding it,” Kaoru spat out.<br />
It’d be easier if he had, if everything they’d known had been a lie.<br />
It would be easier but despite it all, Kojiro still treasured those teenage nights, the sloppy kisses and competitive smirks and moonlight races. “I hope he wasn’t.”<br />
“Still.” Kaoru pushed his bangs out of his face, his skin flush from the wine and anger. “He still needs to pay.”<br />
Kojiro reached across and grabbed Kaoru’s hand. He swiped his thumb on a familiar scar, felt the callouses from the pads of his fingers. “Does he?”<br />
And if Kaoru’s eyes had always been firmly on Ainosuke, his had always been on Kaoru. A familiar jealousy coiled in his chest, a feeling that had only eased for the short time they had all called each other <em>mine.</em><br />
It was impossible to compete with a ghost.<br />
Especially if the ghost wasn’t dead.<br />
<em>Look at me</em>, he wanted to beg, to whine. <em>I’m still here</em>.<br />
But he was a coward, he had always been a coward. The only time Kaoru would talk to him was when he was drunk and that only time Kojiro would try to compete with Ainosuke’s shadow was when the alcohol blurred the boundaries of past and present.<br />
If Kaoru’s response was to chase AInosuke, Kojiro’s was to stay still.<br />
Maybe he hadn’t escaped Ainosuke’s ghost either.<br />
“We should—”<br />
A snore interrupted him. The wine had done its job. Slumped across the table, Kaoru dozed peacefully.<br />
“There’s never a right time between us,” Kojiro sighed. He tenderly brushed the hair out of Kaoru’s face before pressing a soft kiss on his forehead.<br />
The wound they shared had yet to heal. Sometimes he feared it never would.<br />
<strong>iii.</strong><br />
Ainosuke, for all of his savagery on the racetrack, was a fairly predictable creature. His daily routine remained the same, regardless if an adorably aggressive cop stalked him around town. He met politicians all day and warded off his aunts all night. His meals were high class, regardless of their contents. In every conversation he had, he made sure to pick the most proactive response.<br />
For all he had derided Cherry, Ainosuke was a boring man himself.<br />
Which is why today was a remarkable change from it all. Ever since he’d left for America as a teen, Ainosuke had never imagined meeting Kojiro and Kaoru again and especially not somewhere that didn’t involve skateboarding.<br />
Yet, here he was, sitting in the patio of a local coffee shop, holding a cup of extremely cheap coffee, face-to-face with a very hostile Kaoru and a more passive Kojiro. It was a strange reversal to how they’d behaved as teens.<br />
The entire situation was odd. Ever since Ainosuke had returned, he’d seen them one by one at best, a glimpse of both at worst. Not like this, in the bright sunlight. Not like this, while wearing his usual suit. Not like this, as Ainosuke and not Adam.<br />
There was a strange urge to flee, but he had long since decided to stop running from his problems. The only good thing was that the patio was closed off, so he didn’t have to deal with the press on top of everything else. Ainosuke could barely process the situation as it was, without having to think of a way to look good for the cameras.<br />
Ainosuke’s gaze flicked to the table next to them, to where Tadashi quietly read a book, his eyes peeking up every now and then as he watched them. No, there were two good things; Tadashi was still here. He could handle almost anything as long as that remained the case.<br />
He glanced back at his old ‘friends’. Did that moniker apply to them anymore? Had it ever truly applied? Even when they’d first met, there had been a spark between them, an attraction that he had chased down as fervently as he had skateboarding. An attraction that he had smothered and trampled on as thoroughly as he could before he’d disappeared.​​<br />
“I didn’t think you’d actually come,” Ainosuke drawled, smiling flirtatiously. This wasn’t how he intended to start. The words and tone left his mouth anyways. It was a bad habit of his. “Miss me that much?”<br />
“Don’t even joke about it,” Kaoru replied tersely, his voice clipped and short and straight to the point. When they were younger, he had rarely been so callous. He crossed his arms, sitting ramrod straight. “What did you want?”<br />
“My, my, impatient you are,” Ainosuke cooed, leaning back in his seat. He tapped his head. “Is the concussion still bothering you?”<br />
Kaoru’s eyes flashed. Ainosuke could no longer tell what emotion passed through them, only that there was definitely anger. “Hope your ribs are still broken.”<br />
Ainosuke chuckled. How could he have ever called the man before him boring? “Oh, you’ve gained a mouth on you.”<br />
Before Kaoru could say anything, Kojiro grabbed his hand and squeezed it tightly. Softly, he uttered, “Kaoru.”<br />
Kaoru stiffened. He glanced at Kojiro, at their clasped hands, and clicked his teeth. “Fine.” For a second, he was soft. Then he turned back to Ainosuke, as unyielding as steel. “Get on with it.”<br />
There were many things Ainosuke had expected from this meeting, but the odd tinge in his chest was not one of them. It was suffocating about seeing the duo like that, closer than they had been as kids. An entire history lay between them, communicated only with small touches and sounds.<br />
They had looked at him like that once.<br />
They had touched him like that once.<br />
Even now, Ainosuke could see his teenage self sitting with them, filling in the gaps between their bodies.<br />
“Oh, how cute. When did you get together?” Ainosuke asked. It was petty. He felt ugly. He couldn’t stop himself from picking at the wound. “Does Cherry taste like cherry?”<br />
Kaoru jumps to his feet, his chair scraping against the concrete harshly. “You…” he growled.<br />
Truly, Ainosuke had been wrong to ever call the man boring. As calm and collected as Kaoru acted, it only belied the fierce rage and passion that stormed within him. And if Kojiro could draw out the positives in it, Ainosuke would take the negatives.<br />
Any emotion was better than none, after all.<br />
“I?” Ainosuke pressed, smiling benignly. He interlaced his fingers and rested his chin on them. “Darling, make sure to use your words.”<br />
Kaoru’s expression was unreadable again. Anger was easy to find, it had been easy to find ever since Ainosuke first returned to racing. But the rest was hard to decipher. Disgust? Hurt? Loathing? Before Ainosuke could settle on anything, Kaoru spun on his heel and stormed into the café. <br />
Kojiro sighed, watching Kaoru disappear before turning back to Ainosuke. “You just can’t stop yourself, huh?”<br />
Even Tadashi was giving him a look. Ainosuke closed his eyes. This wasn’t what he came here for. “No, I can’t.”<br />
“That’s a pity.” Kojiro sighed again. He tapped his finger lightly against the table. “Kaoru was the one who wanted to come, you know.”<br />
Surprised, Ainosuke opened his eyes. “He did?”<br />
“What, thought it was me?” Kojiro chuckled mirthlessly, his expression bitter. When Ainosuke didn’t say anything, he shrugged. “He wanted to change. Don’t know why he thought this would help. Did you ever miss us after you left?”<br />
“No.” It wasn’t a lie. It wasn’t the truth. Ainosuke had chipped away at himself until he couldn’t remember what longing felt like, what missing meant.<br />
Kojiro deflated, disappointed. Ainosuke didn’t know he could still disappoint someone. “Too bad. He…<em>we</em> missed you. I thought…well, I guess things changed. You know, Kaoru likes bitter drinks these days and I prefer sweet. And you…you aren’t someone who cares about any of this.”<br />
Ainosuke could only stare. Kojiro had never been this direct and he didn’t know what to do with the exhausted look Kojiro gave him. It was filled with regret. It was filled with sorrow.<br />
It was filled with the tail end of love.<br />
Instinctively, Ainosuke knew that if he did nothing, the next time Kojiro looked at him, there would be nothing. They would be acquaintances at best. There would be a distance he could never cross.<br />
His throat burned at the thought. “I’m not that boy anymore.”<br />
“We aren’t those kids either.” Kojiro gripped the table tightly, his knuckles white. “I hoped…never mind. I’m done chasing. Just get to the point.”<br />
As though on cue, Kaoru opened the door, his expression carefully blank as he returned to his seat. “You have a minute and then I’m gone.”<br />
Tadashi’s eyes were on him. Ainosuke breathed in.<br />
For a long time, he had thought he hadn’t known love. That he had never known love. But that had been a lie. He had known it in Tadashi’s patient hands, in Kaoru’s timid kisses, in Kojiro’s kind touches. Ainosuke had always known love, he had just lost it.<br />
No, not <em>lost</em>. He had tossed it away. The only fortunate thing was that Tadashi was still beside him. That Tadashi would always be beside him.<br />
If he didn’t do anything, he’d be throwing away the pair in front of him.<br />
Ainosuke breathed out. He hadn’t come here to lash out. No, just like Kaoru, he had come here to change something.<br />
He hadn’t known what until this moment.<br />
“Let’s skate,” Ainosuke stated simply.<br />
Kojiro stared at him, dumbfounded. “What?”<br />
“I’m not racing you again.” Kaoru snorted dismissively. He didn’t hesitate before standing. “I’m done.”<br />
“I didn’t say race.” Ainosuke smiled, resisting the urge to tease, to taunt. That came easily to him but what was needed now was sincerity. And that was something he had long struggled with.  “Don’t you want to play in an Olympic-sized pool? I happen to know where you can find one.”<br />
“Then…” Kojiro frowned, his brow furrowing as he tried to find a hidden meaning.<br />
Unlike him, Kaoru didn’t mince his words. His voice was cold as he asked, “What are you really after?”<br />
<em>You</em>. Ainosuke was a greedy man. If they were tired of following, then he’d chase after them. If they were ready to let go, he’d grasp twice as hard. It wasn’t enough to just have Tadashi. It wasn’t enough to know of love and let it go. He had never been that selfless.<br />
And he didn’t know if he could handle them treating him like a stranger, like he meant nothing.<br />
But he’d pushed too far and now was the time for a slow courtship. Ainosuke winked. “Nothing. What, can’t a man want to see his old flames?”<br />

    paragraphs:
      `Friday night, or rather Saturday in the early morning. A man, gorgeous, handsome, comes back to his restaurant with a girl in each arms. On the counter, an envelope waits. Inside resides an invitation in the form of a crimson heart, surrounded by black roses.<br />

‘ADAM is getting married,’ the card reads.<br />

Kojiro dismisses his dates to call his oldest friend.<br />

“Have you heard the news?” he asks.<br />

The news made its way to Kaoru as well. Adam is getting married. At S. In three months.<br />

The following day a gloomy man goes to Dope SKetch. He hides his identity under a red cap, but all there know his name.<br />

“Snake!” Reki and Langa exclaim. A single invitation is given, to the one whom Adam once called his Eve. Both teens and the manager read the card carefully. “Adam is getting married? And we’re all invited?” Reki asks.<br />

“The invitation is only for Snow,” Snake replies, to Reki’s despair. He turns to Langa. “But you can bring a plus one.”<br />

Reki beams at the news, until Langa replies, crushing the hype, “I’ll go with my mom.” And shatters his dream into pieces.<br />

Another stop at the flower shop, then at Miya’s school, and Tadashi’s mission is done. Each party of the small group of ‘friends’ they manage to build together during the year have been informed of Adam’s new wedding. A second caprice. Does he have a new Eve in sight? Tadashi can’t tell. He’s even quite at loss of what to do with the information, considering how their relationship evolved, especially in the last few months.<br />

Tadashi, exhausted, rests his head for a second only on his wheel and lets out a sigh before starting the engine.<br />

He finds his master in the secret room where they watch over ‘S’ races together.<br />

“The invitations have been delivered,” he plainly announces.<br />

“Good! Excellent! Were they surprised? Jealous? How did Snow react?”<br />

Ainosuke is ecstatic. He has been for quite a while now. Happy, immensely. Which did a lot for Tadashi’s mood as well.<br />

But for some reason, Ainosuke’s sudden blissfulness makes him quite wary.<br />

“If I may share an opinion,” Tadashi says, eyes on the screens—anywhere else but on Ainosuke—“Why didn’t you invite the redhead? Reki is a good skater.”<br />

Ainosuke turns to him slowly with a grimace on his face. “I don’t want to have to endure the sight of that ugly slime on the best day of my life. It’s my wedding after all, I can choose who’s there or not. Unless you insist on having him?”<br />

“I thought he would be a formidable opponent for a new tournament, that is all.”<br />

Ainosuke’s triumphal smile vanishes from his face. “But...Tadashi, this is not just another tournament. This is the real deal. A true wedding.” He says, very carefully—too much for his standard. “We’re going to the City Hall in the afternoon before the reception at Crazy Rock.”<br />

There’s a blank. A white flash before his eyes, a pain so intense Tadashi almost faints. The aunts have been pressing Ainosuke to marry for months, presenting him a myriad of candidates, some whom Ainosuke dated out of spite and boredness, but one, apparently, who met all his criteria.<br />

And now Ainosuke is getting married.<br />

It’s nothing Tadashi has not expected, yet he feels like his world is crumbling.<br />

“...Do you disapprove?” Ainosuke sounds concerned. Of course, he would be.<br />

“No.” And he proposes before he can think. “I’ll take care of everything, if you don’t see any inconvenience.” <br />

Ainosuke lets out a sigh. “If you insist, I won’t stop you; but I’d rather have had anyone else but you in charge, to be honest.” Tadashi looks down, trying to hide the hurt in his eyes—Ainosuke just stabbed him in the back and he keeps pressing at the open wound; he’s not usually so cruel, not with him, never since they reconciled. <br />

“Do you have any requests?” His voice quivers. He blames the weakness of his heart. “A theme, perhaps?”<br />

“Just do whatever makes you happy. I’ll entrust everything to you.” Ainosuke brings a cigarette between his lips as he looks for a lighter. “Everything but the costumes. I have this.”<br />

When it seems he can’t find it, Tadashi steps in and lights Ainosuke’s cigarette. “As you wish, Ainosuke-sama.”<br />

Red eyes halt a moment on his evident dismay. Without missing a beat, Ainosuke breathes out the smoke on Tadashi’s face, and asks; “Are you alright?”<br />

“Yes. I’m fine.”<br />

Yet, as a silent confession of his blatant lie, Tadashi flees from the room as fast as his legs would take him, and sends Ainosuke in a state of immense puzzleness.<br />

*<br />


A month or so of sleep deprivation and questionable eating habits—and definitely not depression, Tadashi insists—triumphs of Tadashi’s tailored suits. Or so Ainosuke says. <em>‘I’m the suits expert’, </em>he told him, in the car; Tadashi was too tired to ask him when he had time to get a degree. <br />

An excuse for a stop to the tailor, he says, to adjust his jacket.<br />

He stands, his arms spread, in front of a mirror when finally Ainosuke comes back with his faithful tailor—the one who did all of Adam’s costume<br />

“Is he the man?” the tailor asks; there’s a mischievous air in his smile that Tadashi doesn’t like.<br />

“Yes, he is!” Ainosuke is as flamboyant as ever. He oozes confidence and charms, and if Tadashi looks harder, he would see a bit of Adam that shines in his eyes. “I need him to look absolutely stunning.”<br />

“Of course.” The tailor comes to his side, touches them, makes measures. Tadashi allows the intrusion only because Ainosuke permits it too. “There is indeed a small adjustment to make. You have a good eye, Sir.”<br />

Perhaps it’s true, but then why the need for the sudden adjustment? Their schedule is as tight as Adam’s pants. <br />

“You’re going to stand next to me in all the official pictures,” Ainosuke reminds him. “I won’t be satisfied with anything but perfection.”<br />

Tadashi briefly wonders what he means by that before the tailor makes him spin around.<br />

Ainosuke waits until the tailor goes back to his workshop to speak to him again, in a hushed voice. “I may sound like a broken record, but are you okay?” He runs his thumb under Tadashi’s eyes. The skin there is purple. From lack of sleep, and a sort of desperation. “Is this about the wedding?”<br />

How can it not be? Ainosuke really has some nerves. “There are a lot of things that still need to be done.”<br />

Ainosuke lets out a frustrated sigh. “I told you I did not want you to get involved. You have already so much on your plate. Let me take care of-”<br />

“No.” And as impossible as it can be Tadashi realizes he wants this. He needs to organize the wedding of the only man he will ever love. The only way to be part of it, from the shadows; a great metaphor of what his life with Ainosuke has been. “Besides, everything is almost ready. I just have some questions about the invites: I found none for your aunts, and—”<br />

“I’ll take care of the three witches just fine,” Ainosuke replies. He withdraws when the tailor comes back with a tape measure. “And I’ll take care of ‘S’ as well,” he adds, in a whisper.<br />

During Ainosuke’s next two-hour meeting Tadashi scrolls through the emails of the address he created especially for the wedding. He finally settled on a menu and picked the champagne, and out of spite he only chose his own favourite dishes. If this was going to be the worst day of his life, at least, Tadashi wanted to have his belly full of comfort food. So oysters there will be. And salmon. And of course, lava chocolate cakes for dessert, and the reception room will be surrounded by chocolate fountains. Because he loves Ainosuke too much not to indulge him with what he loves as well.<br />

For so many years he thought Ainosuke’s wedding could never be the happiest day of his life. Years Tadashi spent silently listening to poisonous words from his aunts, as he was doing all in his power to make one with the tapestries, no matter how much Ainosuke insisted on his presence by his side each time he had to face them.<br />

But now he’s not so sure. Reading the menu gets Ainosuke overjoyed. There’s the same craziness in his eyes than when he skates to his heart’s content. It kills a part of Tadashi each time he has to witness such bliss on his face. <br />

Ainosuke holds him by the waist in the cruellest, most mindless way. “I love it. It’s utterly perfect.” Then he kisses Tadashi’s forehead.<br />

He leaves without a word, taking another piece of Tadashi’s broken heart along with him.<br />

*<br />

Tadashi is too exhausted for sleepless nights. It just takes him a couple of hours more to fall asleep. The ghost of Ainosuke’s lips, so warm on his forehead, haunts him. And in the mysterious space between awakeness and the secured embrace of Morpheus’ arms, it’s easier to remember what they tasted like. They haven’t kissed in a while.  Not since Ainosuke told him about the wedding.<br />

He’s been so upset that he threw himself into the fray and forgot everything, even Time itself. <br />

The first time it happened Tadashi thought it was a spur of the moment. A way to get the adrenaline from their first beef in forever out of Adam’s boiling body. He chose to ignore the second time, but when a third and fourth time came, well, Tadashi could hardly call it a mistake anymore. After all, Ainosuke said he wanted him by his side for the rest of their lives.<br />

Under the cover, Tadashi clenches a fist. <br />

*<br />

The more they get closer to the fateful date, the pettier Tadashi gets.<br />

A week ago he picked the flowers. The bride’s bouquet. He chose red roses, of course, Ainosuke wouldn’t want anything else after all. But Tadashi added a couple of white chrysanthemums to soften the deep shade, he argued, but in truth it’s just another method to infiltrate the wedding and steal the leading role. He can’t wait to see Ainosuke’s face when, wearing her beautiful wedding dress, her face concealed under the veil, Ainosuke’s future wife would walk along the aisle with a smile, holding <em>their</em> flowers, proudly. <br />

The rest is anecdotic—white lilies on the tables, more roses, red, pink, and white, camellias at the entrance. The rest, he neglected. Only what can touch, hurt, unsettled Ainosuke holds his interest.<br />

On a Sunday morning, Tadashi wakes up with Ainosuke sitting on his bed. His hand caresses his bangs out of his eyes. The tender touch burns like ambers.<br />

“Can you do something for me?”<br />

How Tadashi agrees to drive to the jewellery shop is a true mystery. Perhaps he’s still too in love to be angry at Ainosuke. It’s Fate he should hate. It’s Japan’s politics that is still intolerant of what they are, it’s the aunts’ impatience, it’s his own ineptitude, his mediocrity, to have failed in finding a better solution for them, and for Ainosuke’s happiness.<br />

But doesn’t he look anything but happy these days? Isn’t it all that mattered in the end? It should be their greatest victory. After years of concealing his true self under a red devil alias, Ainosuke is finally radiant. His political career is promising, his skating is unmatched—even Tadashi cannot compete—and his moods? Not as unstable as they used to be.<br />

The rings are strangely sober for Ainosuke’s standard. They are of thick, solid silver, each with a stone, discreet but stunning. One red, the other green. And inside, something engraved.<br />

<em>‘A&S, for the rest of their lives’</em>

Tadashi smiles bitterly at the irony. Once he gets home, he tries the green one on. A perfect fit. A cruel irony.<br />

*<br />

On the eve of the wedding, Ainosuke brings him the suit.<br />

It’s white. Immaculate. It’s made of the finest fabric. It’s the most beautiful thing Tadashi has ever owned—probably the most expensive as well.<br />

Not the most precious. That will remain Ainosuke’s love forever.<br />

“Are you ready for tomorrow?”<br />

Ainosuke radiates gentleness in his posture, in the depth of his voice, and in the warmth of his hands on Tadashi’s arms. It’s been the longest and hardest month of Tadashi’s life, even harsher than the years he only had his guilt to fill Ainosuke’s absence, the only friends he had known and whom he betrayed, the only one that had mattered. Those were two different kinds of misery. <br />

Tadashi has been but the shadow of himself for long weeks, and never so close to breaking. So in a moment of weakness, as he understands this is the last chance he has to voice his opinion before the man he loves is united to another soul until death do them part, when he is asked if he is ready to hand over the love of his life to some random stranger, the word passes his lips on its own.<br />

“No.” How can Ainosuke conceive such a herculean task? How can he ask this of him? Is it because Tadashi never told him, or not enough, how important he was to him? How deeply he had loved him? How he never thought, for a second, of a life without him?<br />

“I thought you’d say that. I know it’s a lot of stress, but everything will be alright.” Well, at least Tadashi can be sure of that, because he organized the whole wedding. That’s the only reassuring thing in this mess: he knows exactly when it’s going to hurt the most. He planned his own execution. <br />

“I don’t want to sound rude, but you look terrible. I’m not sure I have enough makeup to hide those circles under your eyes.”<br />

Again, a tender thumb runs over them, over his mole. His breath is hot against Tadashi’s ear.<br />

“Say...it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”<br />

Tadashi is terrified by what Ainosuke suggests.<br />

“What do you think? Want to take advantage of my last day as a free man?”<br />

A last bite of the forbidden fruit? How cruel this man can be, how unfair life is, and how weak Tadashi feels under Ainosuke’s caresses.<br />

Their first kiss after days of deprivation feels like breathing again. The strong hand that folds his backside brings him back to the living. An ephemeral revival before the inevitable demise.<br />

Full of love, of Ainosuke, of Ainosuke’s tongue in his mouth, Tadashi’s head spins and his legs wobble when Ainosuke pushes him to the bed. His kisses are eager and desperate. He must have missed him too. Three months is an eternity for two hearts in love.<br />

But it cannot happen like this. They cannot fornicate in haste and then say goodbye in the middle of the night like clandestine, star-crossed lovers; the world is already ashamed of what they are, they cannot, for their own pride, treat their love the same way. They need respectful closure. Tadashi deserves it.<br />

He pushes Ainosuke away for a second. “What is it?” says the latter. There’s a hint of genuine worry barely hidden within a charming smile. “A bit rusted perhaps? Or is it that you’re not into married men?” he adds, raising an eyebrow with malice.<br />

“Before this goes any further I need to say...whatever happens tomorrow,” as if there were multiple scenarios, “I love you, immensely, and I want to remain by your side forever.”<br />

“Hey,” Ainosuke caresses his face, kisses the bridge of his nose. “I know that already. In sickness and health.” Goes down to his throat while Tadashi’s frowns, puzzled by his last words. “You should keep your vows for tomorrow. I don’t want to be spoiled.”<br />

“My vows?”<br />

“Yes. Vows, Tadashi. I guess it was not on the list, but you sure prepared them, right?”<br />

There’s a blank. A white flash before his eyes, a joy so intense Tadashi almost faints. Instead, his mind turns utterly blank—it’s empty, pure and simple. Every neuron that was supposed to function decided in common agreement to leave the ship—and his body freezes, hand handing in midair. <br />

“Tadashiiiii?” Ainosuke says; wanting to sound playful, failing beautifully. It’s only panic that Tadashi hears. “Please, you need to reassure me on one point. I know it is insane that I have to ask, but the chance of you not knowing who I am going to marry tomorrow just occurred to me as a possibility and I’d feel better if we’ll have settled this-”<br />

<em>“My vows?!”</em><br />

The long silence that follows feels suffocating for both.<br />

“...Please, don’t tell me you truly believed I would marry anyone but the man I love.”<br />

Returning to his senses after this uppercut, Tadashi stammers unintelligible words. His sight is not perfectly back to normal as well—it’s blurry on the edges—but he can still distinguish how Ainosuke is now walking back and forth in the room.<br />

“I just can’t believe you...Tadashi! I’ve been in love with you before I knew what true love was! How could you imagine I could be this happy with the prospect of marrying someone else?”<br />

“Well.” He can’t believe it. He just can’t. The wedding is tomorrow. His wedding. With Ainosuke. “You did not exactly propose.”<br />

“What do you think ‘for the rest of our lives’ stands for then?!” cries Ainosuke. “...Though I admit I could have been a bit more explicit. I once had the idea of asking you to marry me during a ‘S’ night with letters drawn in the sky by fancy fireworks, but figured you wouldn’t like it. Also, I could have never managed to organise that without your help in the first place, which would have spoiled the surprise.”<br />

Ainosuke only speaks so fast when he’s anxious. If the situation hadn’t been utterly catastrophic, Tadashi would have found him cute.<br />

“I cannot say I didn’t have doubt, because you looked so down the whole time. But, the menu! The flowers! It was, so us! There could be no doubt that you were preparing the happiest day of our lives, and that the fatigue came from how invested you were into it,” Ainosuke stops pacing back and forth. He bites on his lower lip. “I thought you would have understood when I sent you to take the rings.”<br />

“What about them?”<br />

“The stones match our eyes!” Ainosuke exclaims.<br />

“But last time I checked,” Tadashi retorts, “My name didn’t start with an...”<br />

And suddenly he gasps, bringing his hand to his mouth, to hide the sound and his embarrassment.<br />

“...I see it’s finally clicking in. We will never be able to wear our engagement rings by day. The only place we can totally be free would be at ‘S’.”<br />

The A stands for Adam and the S for Snake.<br />

Everything is getting real, so real, and too fast. Tadashi spent the last three months organizing his own wedding according to his own taste without knowing. Ainosuke never betrayed his love. He wants them to be together until death do they part.<br />

The only thing that keeps him from crumbling is Ainosuke, his hands cupping his, bending a knee in front of him.<br />

“If you still have them, I’ll gladly reword my demand. Forgive my trembling hand; I am extremely worried, that after what you went through you would not want to—”<br />

“Yes.” Tadashi says, without a doubt. “Yes, I will.”<br />

“Oh. That was not that complicated after all. I hope you have nothing planned for tomorrow.”<br />

“Oh, just a wedding.”<br />

“Think you can ditch the groom for me?”<br />

“I’m not sure. The menu sounds delicious.”<br />

Ainosuke is overjoyed in a matter of seconds. “I cannot believe you.” He hushes, tears forming at the corner of his eyes, which he will never admit were from relief. <br />

They decide to stay together that night, chastely, limbs tangled and fingers entwined. Tadashi’s heart beats too fast for him to rest at all. He had planned the ceremony down to its last details, yet its proceeding holds a very different savour at the light of recent revelations, one that doesn’t taste as sour, not at all even.<br />

There is hardly anyone at the City Hall. Both wearing matching white suits, they sign a couple of papers and say ‘Yes, I do,’ very soberly, to one another. Langa’s mother cries. Shadow too. The rest just applaud and smile, wishing them the best.<br />

At night things are different; Tadashi stands at the starting line, a ring to his left hand, a rare smile to his face. The crowd is there, chanting their names. <br />

And then Adam appears, flamboyant as he has rarely been, ruby shining on his ring finger, and skates to him at full speed, holding a bouquet made of red roses and white chrysanthemums. He crosses the line as the lights turn green, and the wedding beef can truly start. The first of Crazy Rock. They are showing the way.<br />

Tadashi hasn’t felt this invigorated in a while. They skate, they <em>race</em>; Ainosuke wears his Adam mask and hairstyle, and is not going easy on him. It’s their moment, it’s the beef Tadashi refused to him so long ago, it’s the last stage of their healing. After they’ll cross the finish line, there won’t be any dark side left of their relationship. Their future is bright, just as Ainosuke’s career, and it’s lively; it’s their morning routine and their bedroom who now smells of strong coffee, it’s Tadashi waiting in the car knowing he’s been missed, it’s the sigh that comes after Ainosuke puffs on his first cigarette, it’s their nights at ‘S’, where they skate, with their friends.<br />

They reach the factory at the same time. Ainosuke is going all out, but Tadashi is just as good; after all, who was the one who taught the other how to skate? Tadashi thinks fondly at how their story started; in a way, it doesn’t surprise him that it ends like this.<br />

Not that it is truly an end for them; perhaps ‘a new beginning’ is a better way of saying it.<br />

Lost in his thought, Tadashi loses sight of Ainosuke for only a second, and it’s enough. For his last surprise.<br />

“Tadashi!” Tadashi looks up, Ainosuke is sliding on the guardrail. “Catch me!” he shouts.<br />

Tadashi doesn’t even have the time to catch his breath that Ainosuke jumps into his arms, his deck in one hand, the bouquet in the other. He spins to keep his balance on the finish line, the crowd gathered there applauding his exploit.<br />

Before they are joined by their friends, Tadashi sends his husband an unamused glance. “Was this little improvisation really necessary?”<br />

Ainosuke takes off his mask before he speaks. “We had to cross the finish line with you holding me bridal style, Tadashi. It’s the tradition.”<br />

Tadashi rolls his eyes, but despite the annoyance, and enthused by the crowd’s applause, Tadashi kisses Ainosuke for their first married man kiss.<br />

He was told it’s part of the tradition too.

    paragraphs:
      `Ep 12 post canon, Adam has come to terms with the reality that he will never have Langa’s heart, despite his best efforts. However, his eye is caught by someone else, a fiery spark of red that he once tried to snuff out. <br />


Ainosuke sat at his desk in his office residing in the Shindo Manor carefully watching the massive wall of screens that were currently displaying every angle of the S track. His arms were crossed over his chest, sharp brows furrowed as he searched for the familiar Canadian snowflake that was Langa Hasegawa. Ordinarily, Langa would show with the prissy kitty Miya and flower queen Shadow following suit along with that red stain who called himself Reki. While he was able to catch sight of his perfect snow angel, a realization struck him: Reki was absent. Thinking back on it, it occurred to Ainosuke that Reki had been missing in action quite a lot during recent beefs. Perhaps the little red had finally decided to retire his board and focus his attention elsewhere. The thought amused Ainosuke, but underneath the amusement was also…unrest. <br />
Whenever Reki sought a beef with him, he mostly did it for fun, but also to prove to Ainosuke that he could match him. Ainosuke wouldn’t admit aloud that he almost yearned to see if Reki could reach that place and ride beside him…<br />
Gazing back at the monitors, Ainosuke lifted a brow when he noticed the crowd seemingly in an uproar. He could practically hear the screams of ecstasy and underwear dropping as the sex bomb himself Kojiro was centered on the frame. Ainosuke’s gaze didn’t linger long on the glorious Adonis-like body that his old friend bore, however. Instead, it fell to the one who just challenged him to a beef. The boy stood tall and unwavering, catching the eyes of many as he skated in. A head of sweeping red curls with an undercut partially hidden by a blue headband with a white character, amber eyes that shined with familiar determination and defiance, a yellow hoodie donning an oh so familiar gear-like print, and a short deck with a scratched up underside. A pleased smile crossed Ainosuke’s face.<br />
<em>So, your spark hasn’t died out yet, ne Little Red? </em><br />
***<br />
The first time Ainosuke met Reki outside of S was at a new coffee shop that Kaoru recommended. Kaoru had incredibly particular tastes, especially when it came to coffee, so Ainosuke took his word that the java would be high quality. The pink-haired gentleman would accept no less, after all. What Ainosuke didn’t anticipate was the sight of a familiar redhead behind the counter, a wavy bang falling over the left side of his face that was all smiles as he rang up the customers, each blissfully smitten with his sunshiny disposition. Ainosuke did his best to keep a calm facade as his turn soon came. He strode up to the counter and was met with a dazzling smile. <br />
“Welcome, sir! What can I get for you this morning?” came the young man’s cheery greeting. <br />
“A vanilla latte, please,” Ainosuke’s response was smooth and concise.<br />
Reki gave a nod as he typed in the order. “Would you like to add a pastry to your order? We have delicious apple tarts.” <br />
Ainosuke raised a brow. “I don’t quite care for apples.”<br />
Reki’s cheery demeanor never wavered but something in his eyes glittered as he spoke. “Give it a try, maybe you’ll come to like them.”<br />
“Persuasive, aren’t you?” The redhead’s smile only seemed to widen, and Ainosuke chuckled. “I suppose it couldn’t hurt.”<br />
His answer seemed to brighten Reki’s disposition even further, and a brief thought flitted through Ainosuke’s mind: Reki was exceptionally attractive when he smiled. He’d never paid much attention to it when they were at S but now, it was very noticeable. Ainosuke made a brief mental note to pay the little red barista more attention going forward.<br />
He paid for his order and stepped aside to let the next person have their turn. It was a short wait, and soon Reki was beckoning Ainosuke over with a styrofoam cup in one hand and a neatly wrapped paper bag in the other. Neither flinched when their hands brushed as the goods were exchanged. Ainosuke had always thought Reki was repulsed by his touch, considering how quick he was to shy away from him as ‘Adam’.<br />
“Come again soon,” Reki told him, still smiling away. <br />
“With such sunny service, I just might have to,” Ainosuke replied with a light laugh. <br />
He was then given an interesting reaction from the young man. A splash of pink graced Reki’s cheeks, highlighting the boy’s freckles. He brushed back his wavy side bang, his smile more subdued and shy. Bidding Ainosuke goodbye, he hurried back to the register to deal with the line starting to form. At that point, Tadashi appeared by Ainosuke’s side, ushering him out of the coffee shop lest they be late for an important meeting. <br />
The morning went by in a haze, stuffed to the brim with conferences and meetings. Suddenly the afternoon had rolled around, and Ainosuke had a spare minute to himself-or so he thought. Just as he sat down at his desk, his personal phone began to buzz. Although he would have rather let it ring, he pulled out the sleek, black device, immediately recognizing the number and picking up the call. <br />
“This is rare for you to initiate the call,” Ainosuke said, reclining back in his seat. “To what do I owe the pleasure, Kaoru?”<br />
<em>“There’s very little pleasure in this call, Adam.” came the calligrapher’s surly voice. “The meathead asked me to see if you’d care to play a friendly game of poker tomorrow evening? You can come or not, I don’t care.”</em><br />
“Awww, will you be lonely without me, Kaoru-chan?” Ainosuke teased, practically envisioning an irritated Kaoru glaring at his phone. <br />
<em>“Bite me, you blue bastard.”</em><br />
“Now, now, I thought we gave that up long ago.” He heard the other sigh in exasperation.<br />
<em>“Are you coming or not?”</em><br />
“I’d be remiss to turn down such a delightful invitation from my two best friends.” Ainosuke let out a short laugh before switching the topic. “Oh yes, while I have you, I wanted to thank you for recommending that coffee shop.”<br />
<em>“Oh, you went?”</em> Kaoru sounded astonished. <br />
“Indeed. I quite enjoyed its pleasant atmosphere, the coffee was very high quality,” he said, recalling Reki behind the counter. “And their apple tarts…were surprisingly good.” 
<em>“Apple tarts?”</em> Now Kaoru sounded confused. <br />
Ainosuke merely smiled, even if Kaoru couldn’t see it. “They were quite tasty, yes. I think I may need to go back for another.”<br />
He did in fact return to the coffee shop, so much so that before he realized it, he’d become a regular. His order was generally simple, a medium iced coffee or latte to give him his java jumpstart, but whenever that familiar redheaded barista was on duty, he made sure to throw in an apple tart after a long, lingering moment of pondering. Reki even touched on the matter once, asking “You really like these now, huh?” while Ainosuke would merely chuckle and respond with “It appears they’ve grown on me”. <br />
<em>Just like you,</em> he’d say to himself. <br />
There were, however, some instances where Ainosuke had allowed Reki to see an uglier side of himself, a side that only showed its face at the mention of his abhorred aunts or deceased father. It was easy to see the overwhelming concern on Reki’s face when a visibly despondent Ainosuke trudged into the shop, not expecting to find Reki working that shift but relieved nonetheless. He needed to see someone who could brighten his dark cold world. <br />
“You’ve been looking a bit exhausted these past few days, Shindo-san,” Reki told him one day, the worry painstakingly evident in his voice. <br />
Ainosuke nodded, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I know… What an unsightly look for a politician.”<br />
“I don’t think it matters what your occupation is,” Reki said quietly. “ Everybody deserves a break and a chance to relax.”<br />
<em>He’s so simple,</em> Ainosuke thought. “I am a busy man…but I do appreciate your concern.”<br />
The simple smile he received from Reki did more to energize him than ten cups of coffee. <br />
On an uneventful night, with Tadashi in the shadows simultaneously operating a smoke machine and giant fan while throwing rose petals for even greater effect, ADAM rolled onto the scene, causing the crowd to burst into earth-shaking cheers. He basked in their adoration and ecstasy at his presence, feeling the tension and struggles of his daily life drifting to the back of his mind. Ainosuke was gone, here stood ADAM. Another chorus of shrill shrieks and some inappropriate comments made him turn his attention to the near naked skater sauntering up to him, sun-kissed muscles exposed for all to see. JOE smirked at Adam. <br />
“Yo, been a while,” he said casually.<br />
“Have you missed me, my Adonis?” ADAM purred out, playfully throwing in his favorite pet name for his old friend.<br />
It earned him a nice deep laugh from the other. “You could say that yeah, I still haven’t had a good chance to kick your ass in a beef yet.”<br />
“I had no idea you were such an exhibitionist.” ADAM also laughed, flexing his gloved fingers. “I suppose we can arrange something soon, however, that’s not why I’m here today.”<br />
JOE placed a hand on his exposed hip, fingers looking as if they were ready to drop his trousers right there. “Sorry to disappoint, but Langa ain’t here today. Think he’s with Kaoru…”<br />
“Sadly, it’s not my little Langa-chan that I want to see.”<br />
JOE lifted his left brow and looked ready to question ADAM further. Then, as if to answer for him, a voice rang out, catching the attention of the two men. <br />
“JOE!”<br />
Coming up behind JOE was none other than Reki, his usual friendly smile plastered on his face. He was dressed as casually as ever, a simple hoodie with a bizarre yet endearing print more than likely designed by him, black fingerless gloves and snug-fitting jeans, and basic sneakers. His gear and chain jingled a bit with every step he took, and that strange headband sat perfectly aligned at the top of his head of fiery red. He had his board tucked under his right arm as he came over. <br />
Noticing ADAM’s presence, the redhead’s grin became a little coy, or perhaps ADAM was imagining things. It was certainly different from the well-mannered smile he was used to seeing Reki wear at the coffee shop. JOE seemed to put two and two together insanely fast just with a few quick looks between them. He threw a knowing smirk at ADAM who shooed him away with a gloved hand. <br />
“Gotta go, Red,” JOE told Reki, eyes dancing over to the awaiting fangirls, and guys. “See you tomorrow?”<br />
“Yeah, bye!” Reki waved.<br />
Shooting them both a wink, JOE swaggered away, letting himself be swarmed by his oh so enamored fans. ADAM and Reki both watch him leave before turning back to each other. Only a moment’s pause lingered between them before being broken by Reki. <br />
“Well, good to see you, ADAM, looking as piqued, proud, and pretty as ever. Like a peacock.”<br />
ADAM couldn’t stop the smile that curled on his lips. He loved how bold Reki had become; it wasn’t as evident when they were in the public eye, meeting as just Ainosuke and Reki Kyan, but at S, with ADAM, oh the fire child had grown quite a pair.<br />
“Am I pretty to you, Sunshine?” ADAM cooed, cocking his head to the side. <br />
“Can’t say that you aren’t <em>kind </em>of handsome,” Reki admitted, not losing that bold tone of his. “JOE told you Langa wasn’t here, right?”<br />
“Yes, yes, I’m well aware of my snowflake’s absence. I…in fact, came for you.”<br />
Reki quirked a brow. “Me?”<br />
“Is that so strange?”<br />
“Well, yeah. I thought you hated me.”<br />
<em>Ouch.</em> The sharp twinge ADAM felt when Reki said those words made him thankful the redhead couldn’t see his eyes past the mask. Nevertheless, he kept his lips in the same sweet smile as he spoke. <br />
“Things are…different now,” was all the answer he would give.<br />
Reki said nothing immediately, his expression now incredulous. Not that ADAM could blame him, his history with Reki was rather checkered in red, and not the good kind. <br />
“So,” Reki finally said. “What did you want?”<br />
“Run a beef with me.”<br />
There was an undeniable tightness clenching ADAM’S heart when he uttered the phrase. Reki looked bewildered, to say the least, but it only lasted for a few seconds. A flame seemed to spark up in his amber eyes, and he broke out in an even broader grin. Yes, there was the passion ADAM so deeply missed. <br />
“What’re the stakes?” Reki questioned further.<br />
ADAM inhaled before replying. “The loser will do any one request of the victor.”<br />
“That’s way too simple for someone of your standing,” Reki snorted.<br />
“Do not jump to conclusions, Sunshine,” ADAM warned him, taking a step closer and noting how he only needed to bend just slightly to be at eye level with the young skater. “If I keep the stakes simple, it merely gives me more options when it comes to getting exactly what I want.”<br />
There was a slight hitch in Reki’s breathing. ADAM heard it; and he liked it. Bold Reki was a certainly immaculate flavor, but nothing could top the Reki who’s knees buckled at the smallest display of intimacy. It was delicious. <br />
Bystanders were in a tizzy. Probably the only one around of their little gang was Shadow who was standing amid his own crowd of groupies, cheering them on. ADAM and Reki got into position at the starting line. 3… 2… 1… GO! The gorgeous blonde skater girl waved the starting flag with all her might and the two took off down the S track. <br />
ADAM never noticed until that moment how, despite Reki’s incredible skill, agility, and dexterity, never once did the two enter the zone together. Certainly, his obsessed past self would’ve taken it as Reki being inferior, not fit to ride beside him - yet he didn’t see it that way at all. Maybe he wanted to enter a new world with Reki, something less deadly, more bright, warm and, well, fun. Because that’s how things were when Reki was around, bathed in an unfamiliar, but comforting brightness and warmth and fun to stay in for hours and hours. <br />
The race was over before ADAM even realized it. By a hair’s breadth, he’d won. Reki was truly getting more and more amazing, and ADAM couldn’t believe he was looking forward to the day when Reki’s board would be the first to race over that white line. He kept one foot on the board, the thunderous cries of the crowd surrounding them dulled to background noise as he focused on Reki. Reki was hunched over, beads of sweating trickling down the side of his face, but he wasn’t grieving or aggravated in the slightest. ADAM’s ears were blessed with the sound of Reki’s jovial laughter as he threw both arms up over his head, his midriff showing as his hoodie rose up with him. <br />
“Guess you won again,” Reki said, shooting a smile ADAM’s way. “Just you wait, though. One of these days, I’ll beat your ass without fail!”<br />
ADAM let a laugh of contentment fall from his lips. “I’ll hold you to that, Sunshine.”<br />
“So…” Reki paused before continuing. “Gonna tell me what your request is now?”<br />
ADAM smiled Reki’s way, speaking in a gentle questioning voice rather than with a demand or statement as he removed his mask. “Would you like to have dinner with me?”<br />
It pleased him when Reki didn’t even question it, only answering with an excited, “I would.”<br />
*~*~*<br />
Their dinner date was planned for that Saturday since Reki had a few projects he needed to finish up. Ainosuke never wished for time to go faster than he did during those agonizingly long three days. On the long awaited day, Ainosuke felt anxious, still unsure of whether or not asking Reki out had been the right thing to do, especially since he wasn’t sure if Reki knew that his true face Ainosuke was the face behind the mask of ADAM. But then again, if he didn’t know, he wouldn’t have accepted the invitation. Swallowing his nerves, ADAM went to great lengths to make himself look presentable. <br />
He donned a form-fitting red V-neck–appropriate, one might say–underneath a thin midnight black jacket that came down to his calves and matched his pants, and one-inch heel boots. His hair was slicked up in his S do. He wore a slender set of black glasses, nonprescription just as an added precaution, not for Reki discovering who he was, but to keep his face out of the media and tabloids. They could be quite a pain in the ass. <br />
Tadashi drove him to the establishment they would be dining in, it was an upscale restaurant yes but nothing so over the top and high class. The last thing Ainosuke wanted to do was make Reki feel uncomfortable, after all. <br />
To his surprise and delight, Reki was already waiting outside the restaurant when Tadashi brought the car to the curb. Ainosuke took a moment to take in Reki’s appearance before he stepped out. The young man was wearing a deep blue collared button-up; was it bizarre to think the shade nearly matched Adam’s own blue curls? His black pants were neatly pressed and matching the vest he wore overtop his shirt. He looked nervous, but Ainosuke found it a bit cute. Finally, he stepped out of the vehicle, alerting Reki to his presence. Almost immediately, Reki’s face became graced with a tender shade of pink as he eyed the man. <br />
“ADAM?” he spoke in a dubious voice.<br />
“Did I keep you waiting, firebug?” Ainosuke asked with a coy smile.<br />
Reki shook his head, trying to regain his composure. “Not at all, I just got here… Um, you look…you look amazing, man.”<br />
“I could say the same about you. You clean up very nicely, a real heart throb.” (A/N: this is an inside joke for me & others who know of my Adareki lovechild Aiko who hails the S name of ‘Heartthrob’)<br />
“Thanks…”<br />
“Shall we go in?”<br />
At Reki’s eager nod, the two of them walked side by side into the restaurant. <br />
To say that Ainosuke pulled out all the stops was an understatement. They were escorted by the matradee over to a table beside the window set with candlelight and surrounded by hibiscus flowers. Conversation started a bit shaky as they tried to make small talk while ordering, but the awkwardness was quick to dissipate as they moved into talking about something that they both enjoyed: skating. Reki was quite clever, witty, and very talkative but somehow, Ainosuke didn’t object to the idea of listening to the redhead for hours on end. <br />
Although dinner came and went, Ainosuke refused to let the date end so soon. Side by side, he and Reki walked through the beautifully lit streets, still talking about more than just skating. They eventually came upon an empty park with a structure that let them look out at the city. Silence sat between them. Together, they stared out at Okinawa, encaptured by its beauty under the darkness of night. <br />
Ainosuke’s gaze fell away to Reki, leaned over the rail with a swift breeze messing with his reddish curls. Without thinking, he reached a hand out to catch a stray strand and tuck it back behind Reki’s ear. The gesture made Reki look his way. The flickering yet unbridled warmth of his amber eyes seemed to draw Ainosuke in. Before either of them realized it, they were in each other’s space. <br />
Reki’s hands laid flat on Ainosuke’s arms while Ainosuke’s hands hovered over Reki’s face, fingers grazing the young man’s skin. Their faces were dangerously close, the tension between them rich and thick like fresh honey. It wasn’t clear who made the first move, not that they really cared. Once it happened, the emotional floodgate was destroyed. They pressed their bodies flush against one another, kissing with all the built up passion neither of them knew they had. It was almost torture for Ainosuke when they broke for air, panting with their foreheads touching. He peered at Reki when the redhead then let out a shaky laugh. <br />
“I’ve been waiting forever for that,” he murmured. Ainosuke gave him a look that Reki returned with a smug one of his own. “I don’t have any apple tarts to give you this time, Shindo-san.”<br />
Ainosuke let out a light laugh, feeling an endless wave of joy wash over him.<br />
“Then I’ll settle for your lips.” Reki happily allowed a second kiss, this one shorter but still so sweet. “Truth be told, I wasn’t even sure if you’d put two and two together about Ainosuke and ADAM.” <br />
It earned him a small pout from Reki. “I’m not that slow! …It did take me a while, though. But when I realized that you and him were the same person, I dunno, my feelings didn’t really change.”<br />
“Really…?” Ainosuke muttered with disbelief.<br />
Reki nodded, leaning into Ainosuke’s embrace. “I didn’t like ADAM, but I never hated him. I…I admired him for so long, and even after everything that happened, I still never truly hated him. It just helped me see that he and I weren’t so different, that ADAM was more than just god on wheels.”<br />
He then beamed up at Ainosuke. “And realizing you were Shindo-san, the hardworking politician who can’t get through the day without his favorite latte, with an extra shot courtesy of moi, only made me like ADAM more.”<br />
“Reki–” Oh, it was the first time he said Reki’s name aloud, what a strange sensation. “I’m well aware that we can’t change the past, but if there’s a future for us, I’d be more than happy to walk to it with you.”<br />
As he spoke, Ainosuke took Reki’s hand in his own, lifted it to his lips, and kissed the back of it. Reki’s face was flushed a gorgeous shade of red and he laughed in a bashful manner. 
“You really are a romantic,” Reki said with a small hitch in his voice. “Guess that’s to be expected of the matador of love.”<br />
Ainosuke hummed, intertwining his fingers with Reki’s and squeezing the young man’s hand. He didn’t say anything further, and didn’t really need to because Reki was already tugging him back in for another kiss, laughing against Ainosuke’s lips as they did. God, he never expected to be so enamored with such a beautiful sound. Now he couldn’t imagine not hearing it for the rest of his life. <br />
*~*~*<br />
“Little Langa-chan!”<br />
The snowy Canadian was unphased when strong, red-clad arms wrapped around his shoulders. He glanced back at the dopey matador hugging him from behind, his tiny fang poking out from between his lips. He gave ADAM a pleasant smile. <br />
“Hello, ADAM.”<br />
“Ahn, I so missed my sweet snowflake!” ADAM proclaimed loudly.<br />
Langa gently patted him on the arm. “I missed you, too.”<br />
“Are you by yourself tonight?” ADAM’s voice dropped to a low tone. “Should I keep you company?” <br />
“Don’t get any funny ideas, ADAM,” Langa warned him, playful yet serious.<br />
“Of course not,” ADAM chuckled humorously. <br />
Langa was still smiling at him. “You’ve…really become more beautiful.”<br />
The sudden complement startled ADAM. “Snowflake, am I that dazzling in your eyes?”<br />
“You know what I mean,” Langa told him. “Everything about you is different now, it’s free and happy…like a snowbird.”<br />
ADAM had no words. Searching Langa’s face and those icy blue eyes, ADAM knew he couldn’t lie to his little EVE. He let out a defeated laugh. <br />
“Am I so obvious?”<br />
“It’s okay. I won’t tell anybody,” Langa assured him with a teasing smile. “But you have to promise to take me out for poutine soon. You and Reki.”<br />
ADAM laughed aloud this time. “Consider it done, Snowflake.”

      `There’s wet clay caked into his nails and something a lot like love brushing up against his barren core.<br />
He’s not sure how Shokichi found this place. It’s an art studio, one that offers classes for wayward adults who grew up too fast to pick up messy hobbies. It’s warmly lit, shades drawn against the cloudy night, and mostly empty. There’s the two of them sitting at adjacent benches, Ainosuke’s foot stretched out and playing with the hem of Shokichi’s oldest, most worn out pair of jeans, a stranger with massive headphones glazing an array of mugs, and their instructor soaking old scraps of dried clay.<br />
The only forewarning he received was to <em>“be ready to get messy, babe”</em> from a voicemail on his private line in Shokichi’s breezy tone left early in the morning—but he’d only had a chance to listen around noon, when he was far from home and standing outside under the blazing sun, finally catching up on his inbox. Someone is always listening, though—he’d found an old pair of joggers and a nice-but-ready-for-retirement shirt stacked neatly on his desk at the end of the day, a note stacked on top. <em>Have fun,</em> written in Tadashi’s familiar, laconic handwriting.<br />
Before meeting Shokichi, he would never have worn something so outdated, worn and faded. Image had to be everything to a man like Ainosuke. Paint a smile on the facade so the slash of a grin on his face was beautiful, anything to hide the crackling firmament below. Prim and proper when he was a child, dirt scrubbed away and scraped knees frowned at; all the usual signs of fun and play meant to be hidden away. Joy, a fraught subject.<br />
Shokichi was never like that. From the crag of his face with a once (<em>“maybe twice, it’s hard to say,” </em>admitted over a shared bottle of wine) broken nose wrenched back together by hand, to that haircut that’s just always slightly too long and too short, then his coveralls off-kilter just so, they were a study in opposites. Fastidious and fashionable on one side of the coin, natural and informal on the other. Ainosuke takes pleasure from the most contrived things, he always has. But lately, he’s been finding something elegant in the natural imperfections of someone who grew up unafraid of mess..<br />
Ainosuke’s fingers press divots into the clay. Each flex changes the shape ever-so-slightly, and every scratch carves a groove into the surface, smoothed over by his fingers on the next pass as the lump of clay turns and turns. His hands are covered in clay, cracking into the lines of his knuckles. It makes him pause for a moment, but the wheel keeps spinning.<br />
<em>It’s just dirt,</em> he thinks, before he looks over at Shokichi’s hands.<br />
His fingers are thicker than Ainosuke’s, warm when they wrap around his knuckles and run up and down his chest. Cold in the early morning sunrise, gripping a coffee mug for dear life and begging for heat. He’s got the clay cupped between his palms, the knobbly knuckles of his thumbs hunched over the top; they press in, and the clay grows taller as the center disappears. A blooming desert flower. It takes care to do that, to make something so full of life that it bursts with it.<br />
Ainosuke looks down at his own hands—soft palms and long, thin, elegant fingers. The kind that might feel at home wrapped around a calligraphy brush or arranging flowers; ones that could carve beauty from nothing but instead reach out for an answering hand. Shokichi once wrapped both his hands around them so Ainosuke shivered when he felt the heat of his palms pressing against his bones.<br />
“Your hands are strong too,” he’d said when Ainosuke complimented, with a sly grin, their flex and tension. “It’s the same strength that runs along all of you,” winking, stroking down the length of his ring finger to the very tip. It followed the whipcord of him, but Shokichi’s strength curled itself around his very bones.<br />
He keeps looking to Shokichi for the next steps. Tries to mimic the pattern his thumbs made, the way they carved out the core.<br />
“Clay is fickle,” their instructor had said, looking over their shoulders. Her perfume made her smell like the desert—metallic and mineral, salt-edged cinnamon—and it tickled Ainosuke’s nose while they got used to the shape and feel of the clay. Running their fingers along the surface, the sticky not-quite-mud that blanketed the harder core. “You might think clay’s strong, because it comes from the earth and we’ve built whole civilizations on it, but all sediment carries its own memories of the past. The crumble, the torture, the cracking.”<br />
They’d sat with that in silence for a moment, before she turned around and took the desert away.<br />
Shokichi’d let out a low whistle. “Ain’t she overdramatic?” he’d whispered in a voice radiant with humor, and sent him smiling. <br />
Memories though, that’s something; everything that’s happened to Ainosuke is written there, in the lines of his body, the stretch of him. The grooves in his flesh. His hands are coated in mud—they’re grounded—so his mind can wander.<br />
Though they’d met previously—and both had seen each other’s face in cameras and television screens and at passing distances over the years—possibility snapped into place between them when they met, by chance, on one of Ainosuke's morning runs.<br />
These runs were a luxury, granting him time to empty his mind to nothing but his pace, the music in his ears, the faint scent of pollen. He ran early enough that the air wasn't as thick or hot as it would get within a few hours, but late enough that there was still a faint blessing of sun, pink over the horizon.<br />
On this particular outing, he’d forgotten a water bottle, and thirst—greater than all other sensations—rose in him, dry in his throat and scratchy.<br />
Then, just as he considered abandoning his run to seek out a vending machine, Shokichi—the manager, then, was how he knew him—turned the corner, walking at a leisurely, sedate pace. <em>Flânerie,</em> Ainosuke thought as he caught his breath, bent over, hands on his knees. Shokichi pulled his own headphones out of his ears and raised an eyebrow as he approached him.<br />
"Well," Shokichi started, before Ainosuke had a chance to speak. "Fancy seeing you here."<br />
Ainosuke stood up to his full height so he could meet the other man's gaze with a downward smirk. But as he did, Shokichi pulled something from his bag and tossed it at him; miraculously, Ainosuke caught it.<br />
"Drink," he said. "You look thirsty," with a wink.<br />
And what more could he do but perform to such a beautiful command? Twisting open the top, he threw his head back to drink, keeping one eye on Shokichi, whose gaze followed droplets of water cascading down his face, down his neck, to pool with the sweat already on his shirt. It lingered there, for an improper moment, on the broad expanse of his chest.<br />
Life-giving water to highlight the potential for something more. A frivolity, maybe, that could be bolder. A drowning man never thirsts, but he would revel in the bounty for the rest of his life.<br />
When Ainosuke finished, he closed the bottle neatly and handed it back to Shokichi. "Maybe," he'd muttered, a soft mist of words like morning dew as the sun grew brighter over both of them, "you should take a drink yourself. You look… parched."<br />
And Shokichi had smiled, and Ainosuke had jogged away, and he never brought himself to wonder what he'd seen in him that day. A dry, barren landscape? A thirsty man? A person, desirous for someone to wander the lines of their body and heart, and find peace in the knowing?<br />
Now, much later, he presses his finger into the center of the clay and forms a hole; the shape of the bowl begins to take form, a history being written. There’s history shaped into Ainosuke, too, wind-carved and fraught, and Shokichi’s come to learn the shape of them.<br />
Dating was easy to fall into. Hard, sometimes, because a politician's life couldn't be simple, but eased because Shokichi could carve an extra hour from a long day and pawn off work onto Reki and Langa when he couldn't.<br />
They trade off dates. Ainosuke presses Shokichi into a suit and guides his tongue through a tasting menu, Shokichi wants to watch an open air play at a park. They skate together, of course, and build their own boards together, and sometimes Shokichi does things like this—drag them to an event where they’re both equally unskilled, so they’re on the same level.<br />
Right now, too, looking at their—vases?—they’re on the same level. The lip of Shokichi’s vase is dubiously uneven, more of a ripple than anything else, and although Ainosuke’s has perfectly formed edges, the walls are too thick and too thin all at once.<br />
Twins, in a way. Fraternal ones. Matching in their imperfections.<br />
It makes something in Ainosuke burn. Something for the barren brush.<br />
Shokichi is too focused on his vase, his long tongue sticking out of his mouth like he’s forgotten it's there, eyes lasered onto the lip he’s trying to fix. If he noticed Ainosuke’s trouble, he’d laugh both of their messes away. <em>He’s a rock,</em> Ainosuke thinks. Soft from the tumbling, rolling with the punches, whitewater-soothed edges.<br />
Even though he’s got this blazing heat burning inside him, he feels fragile. Misfired clay, really. Like he’s on the cusp of breaking. Shattering.<br />
His finger slips. It pokes straight through the thinnest part of his vase and tears the entire thing apart.<br />
The wheel slows to a stop; an eternity that lasts a minute. He pulls his leg away from Shokichi, and lets his whole body tighten up. He doesn’t notice that Shokichi stops too. His wheel keeps spinning but his eyes are on the whole length of him, hands left dripping water on the clay. <br />
You cover up a bomb to secure the blast. Lock it down, keep it secure. But Shokichi calls him a whirlwind, sometimes—always moving. A sandstorm in a teacup. <br />
There’s something rolling inside him—winds spreading wildfire around his burning core—and he doesn’t hear a thump but he does hear -<br />
“Ainosuke?” Shokichi says, his clay a clobbered down heap on a wheel slowly spinning to a stop. If he looks closer, he might see a handprint. “My pot’s messed up too. Let’s press our clay so we can start again.”<br />

---<br />

They’re standing side by side at one of the tall worktables, and Ainosuke knows he’s being managed but he can’t help but welcome it. Slowly and carefully they’re rolling out their clay to make it useful again, pressing the air out so it doesn’t shatter in the kiln. Letting out the heat and the wild storm.<br />
It’s strange to think of clay as fragile. The way it comes from the Earth, so stable and steady, only to be willing to shatter when exposed to heat. Heat that could come from the life-giving sun, or the rumbling core; heat that could come from everywhere.<br />
Existence, in and of itself, is a risk.<br />
Shokichi’s hand passes over his, briefly, fingers sinking into his knuckles and rubbing against the wet clay leaving brown patches on his skin. “Hey,” he says, soft as the night.<br />
“Hey yourself,” Ainosuke replies, quieted. He knows Shokichi is looking at him, but he can’t bear to turn his eyes away from their joined hands. They almost look the same—one monstrous appendage, coated in soil.<br />
“D’you see that bucket, over there?” he says instead, and out of the corner of his eye Ainosuke can. It’s the one their instructor was worrying over earlier, draining and refilling it with water. He doesn’t wait for Ainosuke to continue. “It’s all dried clay. Cast off scraps of old projects, things that aren’t useful. But you soak it in water, you give it time, you worry about it.” Care for it, tend to it, like clay is a living, breathing beast that craves attention. “It always turns back into workable clay. It always turns back into itself.”<br />
“What are you saying?”<br />
“Clay knows what it wants to be. It holds the memory of what it used to be, you know? So even when you’re just a heap of dried scraps—“ the kind lanced off the edges of a sculpture to smooth the rim, for example, or to cut a hole in the kettle for the spout—“you just add enough water and become clay again.”<br />
“Or…” Ainosuke says, letting his fingers press divots into the clay on the table. “You hit it hard enough, it becomes usable again.” Something in him <em>burns.</em><br />
Shokichi smiles, but it’s tinged with something melancholy; a candy he once tasted as a child, maybe, made by an old woman who passed away between one summer and the next. “Not quite. You work with it enough, meet it on its own terms, and it becomes beautiful.”<br />
In the fire of the kiln or the flame at his center, it becomes as brittle as it is strong. Trust the clay to the kiln only when you believe in it, that it will become beautiful and hardy. If you think it’ll shatter, it will.<br />
Faith is kinda like love, that way. Take a chance on a promise even when the outcome is unknown; you’ll never see the final shape of your love, if it ends with a burning board or a broken heart or in bed with a handsome man with a broken nose on a stolen Sunday morning.<br />
“It’s not a failure,” Ainosuke says, finally. He’s looking at Shokichi now, the way the soft light in the room paints his face warm and welcoming, lines his out-dated haircut in bronze. A living statue. An artwork, for how he moves him, not because he’s cut from marble.<br />
“Right,” Shokichi agrees. “It’s just a little setback.”<br />
One step back means two steps forward, and by the end of the night they have neat little clay pots, twins for their care, nestled side by side on a drying rack.<br />
They have to return in a few days to glaze it. “Sorry,” Shokichi’d said when they realized, rubbing his fingers through his hair in a way that left some of the clay behind. He’d pay hell for it in the shower later. “I’m stealing your turn.”<br />
“Well,” Ainosuke had demurred, a different kind of fire in him now, raising an eyebrow. “Maybe I’ll sneak something in so we can be even.”<br />
Before they leave—before they wash up—Shokichi runs a mud-covered finger along AInosuke’s cheek. He can feel the tacky brush of clay on his skin before he leans over and kisses it away, his breath a hum in Ainosuke’s ear.<br />
“What does it taste like?” Ainosuke asks, Shokichi resting his head on the meat of Ainosuke’s shoulder. He surprised him from behind, just as he was getting to the sink, so Ainosuke’s staring at his hands.<br />
“Mmm,” Shokichi hums. He can feel it rumble down his spine. “Like clay. Earth, dirt. Your skin, a little bit. Cinnamon.”<br />
He laughs—he can’t help it. His clothes are covered in mud, and he’ll need a manicure in the morning to get the last remnants of it out from below his nails, and there are a thousand emails piled up in his inbox.<br />
He’s going to wear this shirt that had been on the cusp of donation again in a few days, and it’ll be stained with the mud of Shokichi’s handprints as he braces himself against Ainosuke’s waist. But he’s got two pots dying on the rack, made from unskilled hands that are trying hard to make their way in this world. <br />
The clay runs off his hands and rushes down the sink. There’s no memory but the remaking. If clay was once dirt a million miles away, now it’s running down a drain in Okinawa. There are a hundred lines and grooves in the weft and whorl of his fingerprints, like the scattered dunes of a desert, but no memory of failure.<br />
Just silt, finely ground, ready to be washed away.<br />

      `Kaoru Sakurayashiki is gay; it's about as notoriously part of the high school scenery as Minato’s husband having gambled away all their money before leaving her, or Honeywell being the worst English Lit teacher you can possibly have. And yet, he does nothing to clear up this founded speculation regarding his sexuality. It’s not uncommon for an all-boys school to have its share of eccentricities, but usually the guys in question at least try to have a girl on the side or purposefully lead others astray about their desires. Ultimately however, no hiding is needed within the walls of the school as there are not many who would dare overtly mock any trait of his - those who did soon found out firsthand that for a scrawny looking guy, he’s actually decently toned and can land a punch if he wants to. Yet then again, not being pestered doesn’t amount to being understood, even if Kaoru seems very little fazed by not having anyone to relate his own situation to.<br />

Ainosuke, for one, is supportive of that aspect of his friend. A little too supportive in fact, almost as if he were vicariously living out his own fantasies of acceptance by projecting them onto that rebellious boy. Ah, no, of course not, he solely admires that strength of character and how free the other is, assuming stances and positions that his family would most definitely deem unbecoming or crass. What is ‘crass’ by Shindo standards? Taking life as it comes without making each day profitable is crass and lazy. Not coming out first in every possible field is crass and unworthy. Any form of societal deviance or difference from the norm enacted eons ago by common sense, regardless of whether it might have become obsolete or questionable at best with time, is crass and shameful.<br />

Ainosuke Shindo interiosised these principles quite well, a fast-learner in how to behave in order to be rewarded with love, be it from his father or the aunties that often visit; after all, if there is one thing homeschooling did well, it’s raise him according to the values prised in the Shindo microcosm. Except, when he’s out skating… Well, sometimes girls might ask for his number, which is nothing too odd for a charming young man with good looks and slick stunts under his belt. Naturally, Ainosuke never calls them back or gives them a name—or rather, when they press he simply goes with the first that pops into his mind, from the Bible his Shindo lineage adores: Adam. And yet…he finds himself wishing he could ask guys for their numbers with the same ease girls do with him.<br />

Kojiro has no shame in disclosing when a girl or a guy catches his eyes, and Ainosuke is happy for him too. Why wouldn’t he be, after all? They’re friends, of course he’ll be there encouraging his two skating partners to be themselves around him. Hm? If the same-sex attraction of his friends are always on his mind because it is a relatable feeling that he wishes he could allow himself to explore more? Don’t be ridiculous. He’s just...a good ally. Right.<br />

Right now, Kaoru’s arms are wrapped around his own sides, as he rolls in the aisles at the incongruity of the situation. His laughter bounces off the walls of the passageway they’ve cowered under to avoid the worst of the downpour, and his pink strands might as well be glued to his face, dripping rhythmically onto cracked concrete. Every so often, it’s interrupted by the cacophonous roaring of a car speeding by on the overhead bridge, but even that doesn’t seem to deter him from voicing his amusement. The younger eventually lets out a long high-pitched sigh, signaling his cracking up might be ending shortly, presumably because he’s short on air by now.<br />

“Damn, Kojiro got caught so pathetically, haha!” Ainosuke watches his friend tether dangerously the line to breaking into a roar of delight again, but he frankly doesn’t find the situation quite as entertaining. Well, he does to the same extent as his friend, but a little voice at the back of his mind, suspiciously resembling his father’s, whispers that now that Kojiro has gotten into trouble with actual members of the police force for trespassing during their skating escapades, his political career is good as dead. Which is a preposterous thought, as he’s well aware Kojiro means to pursue cooking or some other craft as a breadwinner. This goes to show where his priorities have been molded to lie, hm.<br />

“Yo, Adam, you don’t find it hilarious?” It’s been established by now that of the trio, Ainosuke is the silently rebel-in-training type, incited to greater demonstrations by the example of his flamboyantly rebellious friend and good-student-who-still-stands-for-his-beliefs-and-passions friend. So naturally he speaks up less, not that he has less to say; merely that it takes any Shindo-conditioned individual time to accept any thought that might be deemed improper. <br />

Ainosuke nods, though in reality his focus at that moment isn’t set on how a certain green-haired member of the merry trio is probably going to get a good talking to from his mothers and possibly even get his phone or skateboard confiscated. No, if anything he’s contemplating how endearing Kaoru looks when laughing, or simply when joyous in general. Maybe he’s purely glad that his friend is happy, plain as day. Or maybe…<br />

No, no, that can’t possibly be it. Surely everyone is attracted to their friends to a certain degree, this doesn’t make Ainosuke any less of a straight man; in fact, given that it’s all a matter of labels, he can still have such, er, tendencies and still refer to himself as straight, no? ...Right, that would be delusional. Yes, he doesn’t have to name what he’s feeling and is in no way obligated to making it fit into any given category, but nevertheless it won’t be qualifying as heterosexual no matter what way you look at it. God, no. He doesn’t want to be...that, he doesn’t want things to make his life more complicated, please, please say his reasoning is mistaken, that he is drawn to men in an aesthetic and socially acceptable manner.<br />

“A-dam. Dude, you hearing me?” The latter snaps out of his daze and belatedly nods in agreement to how droll it was to witness Kojiro get dragged away as they sped off even faster. In fact, he can’t wait to hear the guy come back and chastise them for having no loyalties in times of trouble.<br />

“Hm.” Ainosuke hums back in response, both relishing in the lilt of that voice and detesting how even a whole month into their meeting he cannot bring himself to reveal his birth name to the person closest to him; aside from Tadashi, of course.<br />

“Man, it’s like you’re on another planet right now.” Kaoru lets out a huff of annoyance and defeat, leaning back against the wall of the passageway and sneaking a glance, only to be disheartened at how rain is still cascading. “Ugh, I really wanted to show you this one new trick I came up with; it’s not perfect yet, but if I just find the right angle of entry… You see, it starts off as a—”<br />

Only then does he notice that, while Ainosuke habitually perks up at the mere mention of some new stunt to possibly add to his arsenal, the latter has turned his head away and is staring vaguely into the distance. Kaoru scoots over with a push of his arms and nudges the other in the shoulder.<br />

“Hey.” It takes physical contact for Ainosuke to snap out of it and turn back to a worried friend scrutinizing his expression. “You okay?” And before a response can be formulated, Kaoru continues almost without any interruption. “Of course you aren’t. C’mon, tell me. What’s wrong?”<br />

<em>‘What’s wrong, Mr. Ainosuke?’</em> There exists only one other person that’s ever asked him such a foolishly sentimental question. While most people would view this inquiry as routine, not a single soul on the Shindo estate ever seeks to see whether their treatment of him is adequate, whether he has a preference of his own to formulate, or even whether his mental state is at the very least satisfactory. <br />

“I just don’t get it.” Ainosuke doesn’t ever speak much, so the other knows not to pry for an explanation; it will come in due time if ever. For once, it comes surprisingly fast. “Is it greedy of me to date women and not be satisfied with that?”<br />

Kaoru had not expected that, and blinks with eyes widened, but before he can react to that question, the former resumes. “I have all I can desire, yet something is lacking. Oh, don’t get me wrong, girls are great. It’s just… if I already have the security of falling for women, isn’t it indecisive of me to find men just as appealing?” Setting aside that it is much preferable to experience attraction to women, it seems cowardly to want to play both teams as some form of ‘safety net’ instead of assuming a position firmly. Or so Father would say, anyway.<br />

Kaoru knows nothing of Ainosuke’s upbringing, he doesn’t know how the man conceptualises relationships with his peers, nor what his understanding of the ‘good life’ consists of. However, in that moment, all he can tell for certain is that someone that makes up a great deal of his life is coming to him for advice and confiding in him, entrusting him with a secret that has been kept buried dormant deep within. And something, a gut feeling without any solid foundation… Tells him that this confession is particularly challenging for the other to make, that it touches upon subjects he cannot bear alone.<br />

Speaking of which, it’s the second time that Adam has allowed himself some degree of vulnerability with the first one being when he revealed himself to them and shed the hood. What’s more, it’s definitely the first time Adam has done so in front of only Kaoru, and the latter feels such a special indication of trust is not to be handled lightly.<br />

“Thank you”, he starts, “for trusting me. I know this must be hard to bring up.” The younger scoots over some more, smiling encouragingly. “You know, Kojiro and I will always be there to support you, no matter  what. I know how hard it is to accept sides of you that others don’t, or sides you feel they wouldn’t, but I swear: nothing’s wrong about your experience, Adam.” <br />

Ainosuke can feel himself trembling a little, regardless of how much he attempts to retain a poker face. “You don’t need to label your experience this early on either. Just know that it’s okay. It’s all okay.” Is it? Really? Can he...Is it okay even for him, to stand out in such a garrish way, to let down everything his family stands for, to accept he’s breaking norms that were established to keep the world ordered? Years of pressure built up on his shoulders suddenly deflate at the news that his friends are here to convert what he deemed a burden into another element of his individuality. Before he knows it, Ainosuke is bawling like a kid, with Kaoru smiling so encouragingly at him it only makes his tears redouble. <br />

In the midst of his sobbing, it so happens that his hand brushes against Kaoru’s and just as he’s startled by this much contact, more than those around him would go for, the latter confidently grabs his hand, threading their fingers together with a resolute gaze on his face. <br />

“Don’t mind me working on my thing. Just a spell to pass some of my ‘fuck you’ magic.” A smile tugs at Ainosuke’s mouth, and he wonders whether it is a side effect of that charm that his heart races more than in the midst of any skating stunt.<br />

***<br />

Tadashi has always been a friend Ainosuke holds dear, and will naturally continue to be so in the foreseeable future. However, there exists a clear divide between the circumstances that brought them together as children and the way in which Ainosuke has come to connect with an unlikely duo. While the first case was a given because they were the only kids at the estate, it isn’t invalidating that friendship to underline how this new one has added value because it’s the first he chose of his own accord. Furthermore, he met Kaoru and Kojiro thanks to something that he loved, something that fuels his energy and drives him on to new ventures on the daily, the very activity which he would be shunned for back home. For as much as Tadashi encourages Ainosuke, he cannot do much more than show his support in secret and silence.<br />

In regards to skating, and many other things.<br />

Lately, Ainosuke has started to do the unthinkable and sneak out at night with only Kaoru in tow, roaming in low security parks or zoos they manage to slither into. Usually, he’d consider three as the ideal number for a group: on one hand, he no longer feels isolated and dejected, but on the other he can get space by just a shift in body language without worrying the other two will hold him accountable for being bored or having no one to talk to. And yet, perhaps as a side effect of Kaoru being the only person to know his questioning, he enjoys his exclusive company. After all, his friend is an admirable and quite frankly charming person, what is there not to like about that?<br />

It isn’t easy for Ainosuke to admit being ‘different’ from the majority in any way, so of course it’s all the more difficult when it touches upon the very essence of his identity. Thankfully his friends are here through thick and thin: Kojiro doesn’t know anything, however his heart is in the right place and it always shows, whereas Kaoru is a tremendous moral support and Ainosuke would definitely not be faring as well mentally without him there.<br />

Unfortunately, though they now have a bit more of a free reign on where they decide to go, they’re still subordinated to nature’s whims regarding when to skate; when the downpour hits the pair, they cower under the park's nearby gazebo, Kaoru complaining loudly as he wrings out his soaking hair.<br />

“Seriously? Ugh, and I’d just washed it this morning too, plus the humidity is gonna fuck with it- ” Ainosuke can’t lie and say he’s particularly enthralled in the other’s whining, yet he still smiles at the sight of it nevertheless. Because being able to see the little daily things with Kaoru is beyond enjoyable, beyond empowering. Witnessing the little nothings of his friend that end up making up the biggest of somethings in his life.<br />

“Adam. Not again. You really gotta solve that thing where you zone out like that, man.” The latter regains focus on the situation, suddenly aware that his younger friend is nudging him in the side insistently. “I was saying- You okay? I mean, you’ve never been a big talker or extroverted, but last time you spaced out on me, well… You did have things to talk about, so I’m just checking that’s not a case of that.” Instead of addressing that, Ainosuke stares for a few seconds, utterly quiet in the most unnerving of ways, managing to make even the free-spirited Kaoru Sakurayashiki uncomfortable or rather concerned for the split of a beat.<br />

“Ainosuke.”<br />

The rain continues to pitter-patter just within arm’s reach of them, and come crashing down with more might within seconds. “What?” Kaoru appears perplexed, unsure what to make of the amalgamation of syllables that the other just threw at him.<br />

“Not Adam. My name, it’s, Ainosuke. And I’d prefer it if you used it.” How have they gone so long without him disclosing that basic information? Then again, there’s too much weight in a name; a name labels, categorizes, vindicates and condemns indiscriminately. It would have been unseemly to drag his higher birth name through the mud by doing it the affront of associating it with lowly activities or questionable friendships. Ah, there he goes again, sounding just like what Father’s doctrine has moulded him to be; in his eyes, Kaoru and Kojiro are by no means poor company, and skating is not at all a crass occupation. Sadly, say that to his father. <br />

The other is apparently taking a minute to digest the information, his focus apparent on his face. “Ainosuke, huh?” he eventually echoes, before turning to the other with the largest, most amicable grin plastered across his face. “Suits you. And hey, kinda cute name, nah?” he teases, elbowing him one more time for good measure, laughing at his own comment. Yet Ainosuke doesn’t reply and instead awkwardly pulls his board to him, searching for something he might be able to fidget with or at least touch. Why so nervous? No clue.<br />

“Yo. ‘Suke.” he calls, and Ainosuke snaps back to face him in shock, eyes so wide Kaoru is about ninety percent certain he could shove a skateboard in each socket. It’s a normal reaction, given that no one has ever referred to him by a pet name or a nickname of any kind; Tadashi ceremoniously stuck to Mr. Ainosuke no matter what, scared going any further in overstepping his position might be the one transgression too many. Kaoru interprets the withdrawal and surprise as a way of telling him this is definitely an out-of-place call on his part, and sits back cross legged, arms folded as he leans against the fence of the gazebo. “What, is ‘Suke that bad? Sure, it’s not the most clever, but hey you’re telling me this so abruptly I’m not gonna—” Ainosuke shakes his head vigorously, more energetic than Kaoru has ever seen him be in fact, and scoots over with an intrigued and profoundly moved countenance. <br />

“No, I like it.” the former counters, pulling the board flat against his chest in embarrassment. Being sensitive and cultivating ‘close’ friendships is a female trait and only good for doormats, right? ...Maybe this is fine, actually. All things considered, aside from his Father and a few dumb kids who mocked him for being a ‘homeschooled sissy’, no one has ever really attacked him on the basis that he is sociable or opens up about his emotions; which means the only person whose opinion matters to him that has taught him something along those lines is his legal caretaker.<br />

Yet Kaoru doesn’t care, Kaoru doesn’t treat him like ‘one of the girls’ for being true to himself, nor does he even consider acting feminine or masculine a decisional factor in his friendships. That might just be why people admire and are drawn to him so much: not only does he have no fucks to give about others’ impressions of him, he also couldn’t care less if the people around him are a little different from what is expected of them..<br />

“You know, I really like hanging out with you. For someone who used to always have something up his ass 24/7, you’ve loosened up.” Before Ainosuke can complain about both being called a laid back sloth and a high-strung overachiever, Kaoru carries on and silences him with a flick of the wrist. “I like it. It’s a sign of trust. And I mean, fuck, thank god you changed, because I don’t know how you kept everything to yourself- without ever breaking down.” he deadpans reproachfully, flicking him in the shoulder before sighing in his typical ‘what am I going to do with you’ manner. Funny thing is, his friend has not managed without breaking down so far, but besides the point.<br />

Ainosuke has no time to address what is being spoken, as he feels a hand bump against his own, swiftly grabbing ahold of it. Ainosuke tenses, not without reason; it doesn’t feel the same as when the other had been comforting him not so long ago. As a matter of fact, it doesn’t even feel like it’s being done as a friend. Despite that realization, Ainosuke musters up the courage to lean against the other, all while seeking to appease his pounding heart lest Kaoru starts believing his friend is having a stroke; this sign of ease and comfort doesn’t go unnoticed by Kaoru, who looks deeply honored to be trusted so.<br />

“I really like spending time with just you.” These words barely have time to travel from Ainosuke’s ears to his brain, and next thing he knows someone is kissing him. That someone being his best friend. His male best friend. His talkative, curt, pretty, compassionate, lovable, male best friend. And for perhaps the first time of his life when thinking of all things romantic and intimate, his initial thought isn’t ‘is this morally decent’ but rather ‘lord I hope I don’t suck at this’. Thankfully for him, he doesn’t have to internally debate on whether or not to push Kaoru away, because their balance is shifted and Ainosuke very gracefully bangs his head on the stone ground as a result.<br />

Seeing the pure fiasco this is turning into, Kaoru rushes to help him back up and check blood, exhaling with a relieved expression when he spots nothing there; maybe a bump might form at most. “Shit, dude, my bad!” Ainosuke is still rubbing his sore head and groaning as he listens to his friend rant on and on with no end in sight. This whole thing isn’t good for his anxiety-riddled nerves, and it shows in his fidgeting, loss of composure and accelerated rhythm of speech. “Was it the piercing? Of course not, I’m stupid, that’s not the problem- Fuck, I thought, uh- I don’t know, I just assumed you-” <br />

Ainosuke would love to tend to his superficial injury, but after having borne witness to a few panic attacks of the Kaoru’s, the former is not leaving his friend to self-destruct from the inside out. “It’s alright, I’m not injured.” he assures, though even he knows that’s obfuscating the core issue, as can attest his beet-red face. <br />

Kaoru doesn’t relent in his stress, if anything spurred on more by the other brushing off the situation like it never happened. “Nonono, I mean- You know what I mean!” he rebuts, his face equally as red but his expression much more distraught, as if on the verge of tears.<br />

“I didn’t dislike it.” Ainosuke cuts. Still unable to say you liked something that’s not Father- approved, isn’t that right? “I just...need time to accept that this is alright. I’m not as brave as you, you know,” he confesses, awkwardly adjusting the collar of his shirt despite it not even being a millimeter out of place. “I might not...be very accepting of myself, for now at least. But I didn’t dislike it. At all.” And Kaoru can tell, they both can. That ‘not disliking’ implies much more than it literally amounts to, all the more coming from someone renowned for never so much as removing his hood in front of others. <br />

Thus Kaoru slowly threads their fingers together again, seeking comfort as much as he provides some. “Take your time, ‘Suke. I’ll be there every step of the way but, hey, take your time figuring out who you are. I’m sure whatever you find in that aspect will be great, can’t imagine you being something other than that. Really cool and all, ya know? Like how you’re the quiet type. I mean, that might change, and there’s no shame in that…”<br />

Ainosuke will never admit that he tuned out Kaoru’s voice at roughly that moment, instead staring vaguely at the rain still falling a little over a meter away. Yeah, this is fine. It’s a nice place to be in his life, so why worry about the next place he’ll find himself at? It’s not like he’ll be getting there alone, the person by his side keeps reminding him. Maybe for now he struggles to accept parts of who he is, so what?<br />

There’s plenty of time before it stops raining.<br />

    paragraphs: `“Let’s start over.”<br />
The words come to Ainosuke’s lips, unbidden. He doesn’t mean to speak, but he means what he says entirely, hopes for it wholeheartedly. He thinks of crossing the distance between him and Tadashi, thinks of taking Tadashi's hands in his, of letting Tadashi know just how much he burns with it. <br />
He doesn't though. He does not want to assume Tadashi's forgiveness, nor Tadashi's willingness to stay by his side. Not even now that he's finally figured out it's what he wanted all along, all these years of torment, disappointment after disappointment after disappointment. <br />
It's Tadashi who rises above. It's Tadashi who reaches out to Ainosuke and smiles at him, a sight to soothe his hurting chest.<br />
“Let’s,” Tadashi says, and this is the most beautiful he has ever been, Ainosuke thinks. The sight of him as a child, reaching out to Ainosuke with a skateboard in hand, comes in a close second.<br />

-<br />

Starting over, Ainosuke finds, feels surprisingly like carrying on as they were.<br />
Sometimes, just by looking at Tadashi, Ainosuke has to wonder if they ever even agreed to start over. But Tadashi has done his work after all, has rebelled against Ainosuke’s actions by emerging as Snake, by doing what he hasn’t done in a long time, by skating when Ainosuke thought he'd rid himself of the one thing that helped them grow so close in their childhood. Tadashi has nothing more to do. <br />
It’s up to Ainosuke now; he’s the one who has to start over. He’s torn himself down after that race with Langa, and now he has to build himself back up again. He starts with changing his perspective—of skating, of Tadashi. He used to detest the sight of Tadashi, used to hate every word that came out of his mouth—predictable, infuriating, hypocritical. But now, every feeling he buried has come to the surface, every loving, yearning thought back in full force. He feels like he's a teenager again, falling in love with skateboarding, with every single person who could show him something more, something amazing on a skateboard.<br />
He feels like a teenager again, falling in love with Tadashi.<br />



They're practicing in the empty pool, still in their suits, squeezing in a bit of skating after a long day. The moon is full, clouds are sparse in the sky, and when Ainosuke turns to where Tadashi is on the other side of the pool, he has to stop.<br />
Tadashi is beautiful, and watching him skate again feels miraculous. When he skates at Crazy Rock, he's like a god among men, leaving the others in the dust. And here—<br />
Here, Tadashi skates freely. There's no finish line to chase, no competitors to overtake. He skates to skate, and every move looks like it's second nature to him.<br />
This is the skating that changed his life, Ainosuke thinks. This is the skating that turned his life over, for better, for worse. Well—much better than worse these days. <br />
“Ainosuke?” The spell is broken. Tadashi holds his board in his hands, his eyebrows furrowing as he takes a step towards Ainosuke. “Should we go inside and rest?”<br />
Ainosuke waves a hand dismissively. Then, he climbs up to even ground, sits on the top step and leans against the cold metal of the railing. With the extra distance between them, it's harder to see Tadashi's expression, but that's alright. Tadashi is familiar enough that Ainosuke can fill in the blanks. <br />
“I want to watch you,” he says. “Will you skate for me? Like you did before?” <br />
Before. The word sits heavy in the space between them.<br />
“Why?” Tadashi frowns, lips twisting. “There's nothing for me to teach you.” <br />
Ainosuke huffs out a semblance of a laugh. “You know, if you keep skating as you do now, you may very well overtake me, and then there <em>will</em> be something for me to learn from you.”<br />
He doesn't say that he wants it, that the thought of it excites him, lights a fire inside him that feels like it could destroy him if Tadashi were to fuel it. Instead, he shuts his eyes, rubs a hand against his face until he sees stars. When he looks back at Tadashi, he isn't quite sure what expression he's making anymore. Something unreadable, he hopes, or something pleasant.<br />
“But that isn't the point, puppy. I just want to watch you skate; that's all.”<br />
A moment passes, and then—<br />
“Alright,” Tadashi says. “Watch me.”<br />
He turns, takes off, puts on a good show for an audience of one. Exquisite. <br />
Ainosuke brings his knees up closer to his chest, wraps his arms around them. Like this, curled up, cold yet slowly, surely warming at the sight of Tadashi skating, he feels like a child again. <br />



Starting over, Ainosuke finds, feels a little bit like shedding his skin. This skin, this mask that he's grown into, that he's been molded into. <br />
At the core of himself, he's still that boy whose only joy and love and escape was skating. And rediscovering it again… it feels like freedom. <br />
-<br />


Ainosuke used to love many things when he was younger. He used to love a lot of people too. Tadashi, mostly, but also, anyone who could challenge him in skating.<br />
Kaoru used to be one of those people, until he wasn't. Now, Ainosuke wonders if that could change too, or if they could go back to how they were before, or if he could love Kaoru again.<br />
He loves the Kaoru in his memories—bold, driven, persevering Kaoru, beautiful on a skateboard and full of potential. Now, as he glances at Kaoru who's pulling up his mask over the lower half of his face before the race starts, Ainosuke wonders—<br />
“If I asked you to skate without Carla, would you?” <br />
Kaoru turns to Ainosuke, his left hand reaching up to hold Carla where she's still tucked underneath his right arm. The answer is immediate. “No.”<br />
Ainosuke thought—well, they've been civil recently. Friendly, even. Enough that Ainosuke has been skating with Kaoru again, even agreeing to races like this time, for no other reason than wanting to. And he thought, <em>maybe.</em> <br />
So it hurts hearing that, but he knows how to handle hurt. He lets it pass without feeling like the world is ending.<br />
He should have expected this to happen anyway. He might not know why Kaoru is so dependent on Carla, or how Carla even came to be, or what Carla really is to Kaoru, but Ainosuke does know this: decks often have significance to skaters, and some run deeper than others. He should know; his deck is meticulously maintained, a labor of love. And Carla seems to be even more than that to Kaoru. <br />
To even consider the possibility that Kaoru would skate without her was selfish, egotistic; to ask was even worse. Still, undeniable curiosity rears in him, and he can't help but push.<br />
“Why?” he asks, as if Kaoru owes him an answer. As if Kaoru owes him anything. <br />
Kaoru has always been generous. Or perhaps Ainosuke has always been lucky enough to inspire generosity in him. Either way, Kaoru answers.<br />
“She means more to me than you can imagine.”<br />
“More than me?” Ainosuke says, and he isn't sure if it's better or worse that he doesn't mean it as a joke at all.<br />
Kaoru doesn't hesitate, doesn't even pause to consider it. <br />
“She was there for me when you weren't,” he says, but he's kind about it. He doesn't glare, doesn't lace his words with poison. Ainosuke doesn't think Kaoru means to hurt him; it's just the truth. Cold, hard truth. <br />
Ainosuke has nothing to say to that, but it doesn't matter anyway. Time's up. He might not understand nor appreciate nor like Carla in any way at all, but Kaoru seems to hold her dear; he’ll just have to learn to live with it.<br />
Kaoru turns away, and the race starts. <br />

-<br />

It shakes him. Ainosuke didn't expect it to, but it does. <br />
The image of Kaoru's back is burned into his head. It replaces the version of Kaoru he keeps in his memories, the one he thinks of whenever he's hit with a bout of foolishness and misses what was, what could have been: Kaoru looking up at him with moonlight in his eyes and a flush in his cheeks, so close that Ainosuke would only have to lean down just a little bit to kiss him. <br />
Starting over, Ainosuke finds, feels a lot like guilt. <br />
-<br />


Ainosuke lies in bed, hair still damp from his evening bath despite the few minutes Tadashi managed to convince him to spend with the blow dryer. He's tired, his sheets are cold, and Tadashi's hands are warm from running through his hair. <br />
Ainosuke wraps a hand around Tadashi's wrist as Tadashi smooths the blanket over his chest.<br />
“Don't go back to your room tonight.”<br />
Tadashi shakes his head. “I still have work to do.”<br />
“Use my desk,” Ainosuke says. It's situated in a corner of the room, with a view of the garden in front of it and a shelf full of books beside it. He probably doesn't use it as much as Tadashi uses the desk he has in his own room, but it's well-maintained, free of dust thanks to Tadashi's hard work. <br />
“I shouldn't,” Tadashi says, but it's a feeble argument and Ainosuke knows it. There are a lot of things Tadashi shouldn't be doing that he <em>has</em> been doing lately. Staying in Ainosuke's room would just be another one to add to the list. <br />
Ainosuke squeezes around Tadashi's wrist. He doesn't let go. Then, finally, Tadashi concedes. <br />
“I'll have to use a light, and you'll hear me typing.”<br />
Ainosuke brings Tadashi's palm to his lips, kisses his warm, calloused skin. <br />
“That's fine,” he says, and he presses another kiss to Tadashi's palm, and another, and another. This hand that wiped away his tears, and dressed his wounds, and held his hand when he first stepped onto a skateboard.<br />
“Ainosuke…” <br />
There's concern evident in Tadashi's voice. Unusual, but welcome. Definitely welcome. <br />
Ainosuke shifts his hold on Tadashi's hand, carefully curls his own around it and presses his forehead against Tadashi's knuckles. As if he's asking for a blessing, as if Tadashi is his savior, his liberator, his only hope. <br />
“It feels like we're making up for lost time,” he says. It's easier to say it like this, into the space between them, without meeting Tadashi's eyes. “Isn't that odd? You've been with me for years, and yet—and yet.”<br />
Ainosuke feels Tadashi's other hand in his hair, gentle as he runs his fingers through it. Merciful. <br />
“Alright. I'll stay.”<br />

-<br />

Ainosuke approaches Kaoru before he can even get off his motorcycle, and before any of his fans can even crowd around him. Kaoru is flushed when he takes off his helmet, his hair sticking to his face.<br />
It's the most intimidating he's looked since Ainosuke first met him.<br />
“I'm sorry,” Ainosuke says.<br />
He'll only wait for ten seconds, he thinks. Ten seconds for Kaoru to respond, to forgive him or to spite him. Ten seconds for Ainosuke to hope for absolution while his words sit in the space between them, heavy, precarious.<br />
Five seconds left. <br />
If ten pass and Kaoru says nothing, then Ainosuke will leave him alone and finish what he started, cut himself off from Kaoru like he did all those years. <br />
Three. <br />
Two— <br />
“I forgave you a long time ago,” Kaoru says. It's everything Ainosuke hoped for and more, and it's… it's too good to be true. It’s inconceivable to Ainosuke that he could be forgiven so readily when he’s barely even done anything to warrant it, and yet here he is, forgiven.<em< Incomprehensible.</em><br />
It is real though, and it is true. Kaoru isn't taking it back or toying with him. Kaoru wouldn't, and it's the most amazing thing. It's as wonderful, as odd as Tadashi staying beside him through his worst. <br />
“How?” he asks, because he doesn't know how Kaoru or Tadashi could have done what they did. He doesn't know how they could take years of Ainosuke treating them like dirt, like nothing, yet still choose to talk to him now. Because that was what Ainosuke was attempting to do, before; they didn't suit what he wanted, so he pushed them aside and punished them for trying to reach out to him. <br />
Ainosuke almost wishes they would hurt him instead, but they're too good for that. <br />
“How?” Kaoru shrugs. “I don't know. I loved you more than I ever hated you; maybe that's why.” <br />
He says it like it's easy, like it takes no effort at all, while Ainosuke still struggles to let himself say the words sitting on his tongue. But he tries; he manages.<br />
“I hurt you.”<br />
“You're trying not to hurt me now, aren't you?”<br />
This, at least, Ainosuke can easily answer. “No.”<br />
Kaoru smiles at him. It's been a while since the last time, Ainosuke thinks.<br />
“Then we're alright.”<br />



Ainosuke comes back to Tadashi's side, wrapping an arm around his shoulders and pressing a kiss to his cheek.<br />
“I'll never let you go, you know. Now that I've found you again, I'll never let you go. I'll do everything for you to love me.”<br />
“I do love you,” Tadashi says, and it only makes Ainosuke hold him tighter. <br />
Tadashi is his Eve; Ainosuke knows that now. And perhaps even Eve is too simple a word to summarize everything Tadashi is to him. Tadashi is his ruin and his savior in the same skin. His love, first discovered, then rediscovered.<br />
“Then I'll do everything for you to keep loving me,” he says. He can't make the same mistake again. He won't. <br />
Tadashi turns, leans closer into Ainosuke's space. Ainosuke feels Tadashi's hands curl around his waist, and he catalogues it in his mind, this feeling of being wanted, being forgiven. This feeling of being loved.<br /> 
-<br />


Starting over, Ainosuke finds, has been more difficult than he thought it would be. But it will be worth it.
It's already worth it.

    paragraphs:
      `All Ainosuke could hear was the sound of the pouring rain against his window. A sudden shower had come out of nowhere and sent everyone running for cover as soon as it was clear to everyone that skating would be impossible for the rest of the night.<br />
Not that people were in the mood for skating, anyway. Not after the way the last beef had ended.<br />
Ainosuke couldn’t help but think to himself that the rain had already washed the blood off the side of Crazy Rock by then. Water washes sin away, apparently, but that sudden storm did nothing to lessen the strange feeling that tied his stomach in knots.<br />
If he were to be honest, he could barely remember anything about the beef and how it had ended; he knew that Cherry was on the ground and injured, as was he aware that he threw a choice of venomous words his way before theatrically storming off, but he wasn’t sure of much more. He couldn’t remember if Cherry had been openly bleeding, or if he had any visibly misshapen limbs as he laid sprawled over the dirt track, and neither could he remember what exactly he had said to him.<br />
Ainosuke did not care about Cherry (or Joe, or anyone else for that matter), so the fact that he was still awake and unable to convince his restless body into sleep was a surprise. It was very late and he knew that he had a series of important meetings come morning; he had absolutely no reason to want to be awake still… and yet, there he was.<br />
No good was going to come from him lying in bed, trying to force himself to sleep when he clearly could not. Reluctantly, Ainosuke got out of bed and shuffled his sleep-deprived self to his office. There was always work to be done, therefore he had better ways to spend his sleepless night.<br />
It shouldn’t have been a surprise that he was struggling to focus on his reading, with flashes of what had happened - or rather, what he had done - creeping up on him and leaving him to realise that he had no recollection of the paragraph he had been trying to read for the past few minutes, but the simple fact was that he did not like the way it felt.<br />
He did not sleep a single wink that night, and it showed the following morning.<br />
Tadashi was too prudent and professional to bring any attention to the fact that his boss looked like utter shit, but the fact that he appeared unprompted with strong coffee and cigarettes first thing in the morning let Ainosuke know that the secretary knew he had been awake all night.<br />
Luckily for them both, the day was reasonably clear and most of their work could be conducted through the phone and from within the politician's office, minimising the amount of people that would have to be exposed to the sleep-deprived (and likely distracted and irritable) Diet Member.<br />
Ainosuke pushed through work as he normally did, allowing himself more frequent coffee breaks and small moments to rest his tired eyes between emails, but otherwise keeping his restlessness to himself.<br />
It was only when lunch time rolled around and Tadashi brought him a tray with his meal and a little piece of paper, folded in half and resting right alongside his cutlery.<br />
He was curious by nature, so there was little Ainosuke could do other than reach right in for the note as soon as the tray was set down in front of him. He unfolded it, frowning immediately as soon as he laid eyes on what it said.<br />
<em>Chubu Tokushukai Hospital, Second floor, Room 237.</em>
"Tadashi, what is this?" Ainosuke asked even if he knew exactly what it was.  <br />
"Details on Mr. Sakurayashiki, sir," Tadashi replied with a neutral expression. "Would you like to know more?" <br />
Ainosuke should have expected Tadashi to get himself involved and made sure he had a clear understanding of what he had done, and the possible outcomes and risks for him. He knew well that his poor secretary was likely sweating bullets over the possibility of Diet Member Shindo getting dragged into a public scandal and becoming disgraced if the calligrapher chose to sue him or go to the police over his injuries, but he himself wasn’t worried. The one good thing about <em>having history</em> with Cherry meant that Ainosuke could be certain that he wouldn’t dare; he was far too sentimental, too hung up on the past, so regardless of how hurt he was or how vindictive he could be, he simply wouldn’t ruin his political career just like that.<br />
And yet, he didn’t know how to feel about the fact that Tadashi had gone and found this all out for him; did his dog think he was feeling guilty? That he wanted to apologise, or at the very least check on him? Because he did not, and the mere thought was enough to make him scowl.<br />
Ainosuke did not respond to his question, so Tadashi took his silence as permission.<br />
"It appears he has no broken bones, but he seems to have dislocated his right shoulder on impact plus a sprained ankle. He did suffer a concussion, and was in need of stitches to the side of his head, but it all seems to point to the fact that he will recover well without much intervention.”<br />
Ainosuke had not expected the sudden wave of relief that washed over him as soon as it was confirmed that Cherry was relatively okay and would heal without any lasting sequels of the incident. He was not prepared to confirm how guilty he felt, but at least he could allow himself to find comfort in the fact that his once-friend would be just fine.<br />
"If I may, sir, visiting hours run until six. The virtual meeting with Mr. Isagawa should finish no later than four," Tadashi offered, unprompted.<br />
“Well, you may not,” Ainosuke said, scowling at the man before him and shooting him down.<br />
"My apologies, Ainosuke-sama,” Tadashi replied, giving him a short bow before excusing himself and allowing his master some space. <br />
Despite telling Tadashi off, Ainosuke couldn't deny that the little folded paper was burning a hole in the back of his mind. He kept thinking that he <em>should</em> force himself to go see him, but he wasn't quite sure of what he was supposed to say if he got there - there was just no fool-proof way to apologise to someone after smashing their face in with a skateboard. <br />
He shook his head, pushing his half-eaten lunch away as he reached for his tablet and the endless papers he was meant to read and understand in order to weigh in on policy with an eloquent opinion. It was easier to bury himself with work than to wonder about whatever Cherry was doing and what the outcome of the unsavoury ending to their beef would be.<br />
Ainosuke waddled through the rest of his day without paying too much mind to whatever he did. This wasn’t the first time he had to force himself to power through work with barely any sleep at all, so he was no stranger to the heavy fog that washed over as dinner came, with him hanging on to wakefulness by one, single thread.<br />
As expected, that night he turned in early, thinking that falling asleep would be easy given how exhausted he was feeling. He was right in that he found himself drifting off as soon as his head touched the pillow, but he simply could not hold on to the sleep. He would wake up every half hour, tossing and turning in bed as he was somehow too hot and too cold at the same time.<br />
By the time the clock struck two, he had given up. There was simply no way he was going to be able to fall asleep again - and even if he did, he would inevitably wake up just a handful of minutes later, so it was an useless endeavour.<br />
Sleep deprivation was surely playing with him, as the intrusive idea to get up and head to the hospital <em>right then</em> creeped into Ainosuke’s mind and glued itself to his brain. He told himself that he’d get there, be told that Cherry was home already, and then have no choice but to go back home and <em>get some goddamned sleep.</em> And that would be that, enough to get it out of his system and let him go back to his normal schedule.<br />
Ainosuke got up and got dressed, enthralled by this irrational idea of his and as he made his way through the hallways as quietly as possible and in the dead of night. The fact that this was almost an exact parallel with how he used to sneak out as a teenager was not lost on him; back then, he followed the siren song of skating (and later on, of the possibility of a hot and heavy make out session in a dim alleyway), and now… well, now he wasn’t sure of what he was chasing after. He refused to think about the fact that this was absolutely not the first time he snuck out in hopes to slink into Cherry’s room.<br />
He told himself that there was no need to wake Tadashi or anyone else up, deciding he would drive himself to the hospital. Because he <em>could</em> drive. The fact that he <em>hadn’t</em> ever since he passed his test as a youth had absolutely nothing to do with anything.<br />
Ainosuke made it to the hospital without causing a major traffic accident in his way, perhaps aided by how he seemed to be the only car on the road given that it was the middle of the night. Whatever the case was, he parked the car and proceeded to make his way inside.<br />
He was well acquainted with the perks that being disgustingly rich and powerful brought along, so the fact that it was way past visiting hours meant nothing to him. All it took was a brief word with the nurse in charge and the promise of a generous donation to the hospital for him to be in without further disturbances.<br />
As a man that had been blessed with good health and luck to avoid serious damage despite his dangerous hobbies, Ainosuke had never spent much time wandering the cold and antiseptic halls of a hospital ward. He decided he didn’t like it, so he better be done with <em>whatever he was doing</em> and leave as soon as he could.<br />
Finding Cherry’s room within the little maze of recovery suites was a pain in the arse, so he was so relieved once he found the right room that he walked straight in without pausing to think about it.<br />
“For the last time, I’m <em>fine,</em>” Kaoru started the second he heard footsteps at the door “I’m not talking to any one abou- oh.”<br />
All of a sudden, Ainosuke felt completely out of his depth. It was the middle of the night <em>and</em> Kaoru was injured, so he had been banking on him being asleep. Never in a million years had he thought to prepare himself for the off-chance of him being fully awake, alert and demanding answers from him.<br />
“What are you doing here?” Kaoru pressed once it was clear that he wasn’t saying anything, frozen where he stood, just a couple of steps past the door and looking lost.<br />
“Why are you <em>awake?</em>” Ainosuke blurted, almost offended by the idea.<br />
“What a way to make this even creepier, Ainosuke. First you knock me unconscious, and then you come in the dead of night expecting me to be out still? Give me one good reason not to call the nurse.”<br />
“Go ahead, call the nurse. Whatever,” Ainosuke said, folding his arms over his chest and shrugging. What was it about this man that annoyed him in exactly the right ways to make him act like a stupid high-schooler, even after so many years?<br />
“Please. You don’t get to act all indignant after ignoring me for years and then breaking my face.”<br />
“Your face looks fine.”<br />
“Yeah. Not thanks to you, fuckhead.”<br />
Ainosuke sighed, allowing a moment of calm to wash over them as they took a breath and continued to figure out what he wanted to do. He was there already, so he might as well do something with this rare opportunity to talk to each other.<br />
“What do you want, anyway? Did you come to beg me not to sue the fuck out of you?” Kaoru asked with a smirk.<br />
“I know you won’t.”<br />
“Why are you so sure?” <br />
“Because you might be a bitch, but you’re not an arsehole,” Ainosuke said, looking at the injured man in bed.<br />
“You’ve got such a gift with words, Diet Member Shindo,” Kaoru said, rolling his eyes and looking like he was dying to cross his arms to add dramatic flair but was unable due to the sling holding his right arm in place. “You know nothing. You’ve refused to speak to me for a whole decade, you don’t know anything about whether I am an arsehole or not.”<br />
Ainosuke couldn’t help but shrug. He was right - they hadn’t really spoken to each other ever since they were a couple of teenagers, so being there, having a conversation in the middle of the night, felt close to unreal.<br />
Heavy silence washed over the room once more, leaving the two men to search the floor for words as nothing but the quiet buzz of the halogen lights on the corridor filled the air. Ainosuke knew that he was supposed to say <em>something</em> now that he had gone through the trouble of making his way there in the middle of the night, but he simply didn’t know what he was supposed to say. Or rather, he <em>did know</em>, but had absolutely no clue of how to go about it.<br />
Whether it was because of his money and power, the way he had been raised, or a mixture of both, Ainosuke had trouble remembering when was the last time he apologised for something <em>and actually meant it</em>. Sure, he was perfectly capable of spouting out an outrageous amount of performative <em>‘I’m terribly sorry’s</em> due to his position, but none of those concerned him personally or involved his feelings at all.<br />
The particular predicament in which he found himself right now involved <em>pretty much every single one</em> of his most personal feelings. And he didn’t know what to do with himself.<br />
“I should be sleeping. And you should let your secretary sleep instead of making him drive you around this time of night,” Kaoru said, snapping Ainosuke out of his thoughts. <br />
He needed to say something, anything, before that encounter came to an end, as he knew well that he wouldn’t have it in him to try and do this again.<br />
“Why didn't you stop?” Ainosuke blurted out.<br />
“Excuse me?” Kaoru exclaimed, sounding like he couldn’t quite believe what he was being told.<br />
“You <em>know</em> how the Full Swing Kiss works. Why <em>the fuck</em> did you sprint at me?”<br />
“So now it’s <em>my fault</em> you clubbed me in the face?”<br />
“Yes!”<br />
Kaoru looked at him in wordless outrage.<br />
“You know how it works! You’re meant to stop, or bail, or fucking duck. Not rush at it,” Ainosuke elaborated. “If there’s someone in the whole of ‘S’ that knows how to avoid the Kiss, it is you.”<br />
Ainosuke didn’t often think back on their youth or the fact that they had been inseparable back in the day, but it was inevitable when talking about skating and, specifically, the dangerous manoeuvre that <em>Cherry himself</em> had come up with on one wet autumn day over a decade ago.<br />

Usually, he would squash the thoughts as soon as they popped into his mind, but it was clear that there was no way to discuss the current incident, the Full Swing Kiss, and everything that led them to an awkward encounter in a hospital room in the middle of the night without touching on everything they had once been to each other.<br />
“I never thought you’d use the Kiss on me. I wasn’t expecting it,” Kaoru admitted eventually, defeated.<br />
“Why?”<br />
“You know what, I don’t know,” Kaoru spat out. “I don’t know why I thought I’d get treated differently by you.”<br />
Ainosuke knew <em>exactly why</em> the other man thought he would somehow get a different side of the Matador of Love while on the track, but neither of them dared to say it out loud. After all, what good could come out of talking about a teen love that was cut short over a decade ago?<br />
They were both adults now. They had their own lives and had very little reason to interact with each other outside of ‘S’, so there was absolutely nothing to be gained from reminiscing about the many nights they spent together and the new and exciting discoveries they made in each other's arms during their formative years.<br /> 
Ainosuke kept telling himself that there was no reason to think about their shared past and how deeply they had hurt each other, but not even he could deny the fact that a decade of repressed emotion and misplaced anger had played a part in what had happened on the track the previous night.<br />
"If anything, you're the one person I've used the Kiss on," Ainosuke admitted after an admittedly uncomfortable silence.<br />
This was enough to catch Kaoru's attention, leaving Ainosuke to feel his eyes burning a hole through him.<br />
The calligrapher didn't need to pretend to be obtuse and ask why: once upon a time, the Kiss had been <em>their move,</em> their addition to the complex world of street racing. Their legacy, established just weeks before everything they had was uprooted.<br />
"Apologise," Kaoru demanded.<br />
Ainosuke hesitated.<br />
"That's what you came here to do. Now, apologise. Say <em>'Cherry, I'm sorry I knocked you out and sent you to the hospital.'</em> Say it," he insisted.<br />
"I don't need to say it. You already know that," Ainosuke defended: did he really have to humiliate himself like that when they both knew what his intentions were?<br />
"So you <em>are</em> sorry." <br />
Ainosuke shrugged.<br />
"Don't be childish. You're a politician, for fuck's sake. Isn't it your job to pretend to be sorry for shit? Least you can do is put an act up."<br />
Ainosuke sighed and looked at him before bowing in his direction.<br />
"I'm so terribly sorry about the past series of events, Mr. Sakurayashiki. I cannot begin to apologise enough for the current circumstances and the series of mistakes that led up here. I will see to ensure matters are mended and none of these faults go unpunished or repeat themselves," Ainosuke said, punctuating his apology with another bow before crossing his arms across his chest.<br />
He couldn't bring himself to apologise on his own right, but he was very capable to channel his professional side and regurgitate platitudes until any aggrieved party felt satisfied.<br />
Of all possible outcomes, he had never expected Kaoru to openly laugh at him and his apology. He hadn’t heard the uptight calligrapher laugh since their teenage years, so he was more pleasantly surprised than he ever thought he’d be.<br />
“Fine. Whatever. Now, get out of my room and go to sleep,” Kaoru said, his words dry but dripping with a certain fondness Ainosuke did not think he was entitled to. <br />
As inclined as Ainosuke was to argue and try to stay simply because he had just been told not to, he decided to - for once - be an adult and do what was asked of him. He gave the calligrapher a half-baked wave, turned on his heel and left the room. <br />
He did not stop at all until he was back in his car and ready to head back home to resume his life where he had left it.<br />
-<br />
Kaoru did not allow himself to ponder too much on that midnight encounter. He knew better than to try and understand Adam and the crazy impulses that pushed him through life, so he allowed the memory of that uncertain apology to lie in a realm of things that might as well have been an opioid-powered dream.<br />
He knew that apology had virtually no chance to bleed into their day-to-day life, so it didn’t change anything between them. He was better off taking whatever comfort he could find on the fact that he apologised and simply moving on from it afterwards.<br />
Because of this, he had no clue of what to expect when a delivery man carrying a large gift box showed up at his door and demanded his signature before abandoning the package there, for the injured man to wrestle with.<br />
It was heavy - so much so that he nearly didn’t bother bringing it in - but a mixture of stubbornness and being <em>slightly high</em> on painkillers forced him to power through it long enough for the box to be in the middle of his sitting room.<br />
Kaoru would soon find out that the alarmingly large amount of money that sat inside that box accounted for just over three weeks wages at his current pay rate. Three weeks, enough for his <em>writing arm</em> healed up enough for him to pursue his profession again.<br />
There was no indication as to who had sent him such a present, but there was not a single doubt in Kaoru’s mind.<br />
<strong>[16:27] K. Sakurayashiki:</strong> <em>If you’re going to send me money, use the fucking bank. Idiot. Too much money to have it just sitting around in my house. Makes me feel like an escort. Or a drug dealer.</em><br />
Kaoru had spent years trying to text or call Ainosuke, well aware by then that he had his number blocked and that there was no point going the extra mile to try and bypass that boundary. It didn’t bother him too <em>much</em> nowadays, embracing the cathartic possibilities that having a channel to talk at <em>Adam</em> without necessarily talking <em>to him</em> brought.<br />
Having his phone vibrate with a new incoming text nearly caused Kaoru to drop it, staring in disbelief as a little <em>thumbs up</em> emoji appeared on his text log, just on the other side of the screen. Apparently, his number was no longer blocked. And on top of that, Ainosuke had deigned himself to signal that he had read the text.<br />
He knew there was no text message coming his way right then, but even a chronic pessimist like himself had a hard time seeing that stupid little icon as anything other than what it was: hope for a different future.

    paragraphs:
      `“You should teach me how to cook,” Ainosuke suggested as he watched Kojiro preparing a meal. He always admired the way Kojiro made his way around the kitchen. There was a sort of grace about it, as he brisked to the stove to stir the sauce that was boiling and turned back to the bread he had been buttering and preparing for the oven. <br />

He could see the years of practice, from how Kojiro held his fingers against the vegetables he was cutting to the way he kneaded dough with such delicate force. He was entranced by every single way Kojiro made his way around the kitchen. It reminded Ainosuke of the way he danced on his own skateboard, with grace and precision. One small slip on his board and he was bailing. And in Kojiro’s case, one small slip leads to a ruined meal or a trip to the hospital.<br />

Kojiro stopped what he was doing and turned to face Ainosuke, “Oh?” he asked, his eyebrows furrowing. <br />

Ainosuke couldn’t help but smile, after all, it didn’t seem that far off of a request, “Something wrong with that? Perhaps I wanted to surprise you with dinner when you come home,” he said, resting his chin on his hand and giving Kojiro a smile. <br />

“You know I don’t mind cooking after work,” Kojiro said as he turned away from Ainosuke to check the food on the stove. <br />

Pouting, Ainosuke moved from the island and stood behind Kojiro, wrapping his arms around his talented boyfriend’s waist, “Yes Love, but think about how nice it would be to come home and all you have to do is heat something in the microwave for a few minutes?” he stood on his toes so he could hook his chin over Kojiro’s broad shoulders. <br />

“You do make a good point...Is there anything specific you’d like to make?” Kojiro asked as he moved  vegetables into a pan, drizzling them with some olive oil and herbs. <br />

Moving away from Kojiro so he could move freely about the kitchen once more, Ainosuke grabbed two wine glasses and poured some Chardonnay into them.<br />

“Well, we can’t go wrong with Tortilla de Patatas. But if you’re asking for specific recipes, my mother used to make a delicious Spanish Beef Stew when I was younger. She would make it during the winter holidays and whenever I or my father were sick. I’d have to go digging for the recipe, since it’s probably packed away, but that’s something I’d like to learn to make. Especially with our upcoming trip to Madrid, it’d be nice to have it during the colder days,” he explained as he took his seat.<br />

“And most importantly, this is supposed to be a vacation after all, so I’d love to give you a break from cooking too,” Ainosuke added with a wink towards Kojiro.<br />

Kojiro turned to face Ainosuke with a fond look on his face, “Okay, you’ve made your point Amore della mia vita.” He laughed, then he turned away from Ainosuke again and placed a pan in the oven before setting a timer. <br />

Grinning, Ainosuke took a sip of his wine, tilting his chin up when Kojiro came to sit with him, lips pursed, asking for a kiss. <br />

Kojiro obliged, kissing him gently before joining him at the counter. They quietly talked about how their days were. Ainosuke had been busy finalizing the contracts for a youth center in Okinawa and Kojiro had spent most of his day watching as repairmen came in to fix one of the stoves. <br />

It was when the timer dinged that their conversation came to a lull as Kojiro stood up to finish preparing their dinner. <br />

----<br />

A few weeks had passed before Ainosuke finally got around to searching for the recipes he had mentioned to Kojiro. After scouring his basement for hours to find the totes that held his late mother’s belongings, he was relieved that he didn’t manage to lose them.<br />

“Oh Joey~” Ainosuke trilled as he made his way into his estate’s upstairs office. Kojiro was sitting at his desk, hunched over what looked to be inventory paperwork but looked up when Ainosuke called out his S nickname. <br />

Kojiro set his pen down and pushed his glasses up against his face. “Did you find the recipes?” he asked.<br /> 

Ainosuke hummed, handing over a large, black binder that contained his mother’s recipe cards. “They’re on the first page, but there’s quite a few recipes that I thought we could try as well,” he explained. <br />

Kojiro flipped through the different recipes, skimming through all the potential options. “I know I promised I’d teach you how to make Spanish beef stew, but maybe we can start out with a Tortilla de patatas? It’s a great recipe for beginners,” he said, looking up from the binder. <br />

Ainosuke’s face lit up. “That sounds delightful! What do we need? I’ll go to the store and pick them up at once!” he said eagerly. <br />

Looking up at Ainosuke with wide eyes, Kojiro shook his head and let out an affectionate sigh. He looked over the cards before writing down what they would need on a piece of paper and handing it over to Ainosuke.<br />

“Here’s everything and don’t hesitate to call me if you can’t find something,” Kojiro offered.<br />

Ainosuke beamed and took the list before leaning over the desk and kissing Kojiro lightly. “I promise. I’ll be back soon darling,” he sang.<br />

A few hours had passed when Ainosuke finally arrived home, bursting through the front door with multiple bags in hand.<br />

Kojiro was sitting on the living room’s couch and gave Ainosuke a curious glance, but Ainosuke ignored him as he set the bags down on the living room coffee table.<br />

“What? I picked up a few other things that we needed,” he gleamed, revealing sponges and dish soap.<br />
Kojiro couldn’t help but laugh and went to help Ainosuke put away the groceries. As he did, he made sure to set aside the ingredients for the Spanish omelette and put the rest away.<br />
Once the kitchen counter and island was cleared, Kojiro pulled out a colander and put the potatoes in it before bringing them to the sink to rinse them.<br />
”Baby, can you grab the peeler for me? It’s in the drawer by the oven,” Kojiro asked.​​<br />
Ainosuke nodded and turned to the oven to figure out which drawer it was. After opening what felt like all of them, he found the tool he was looking for. He held it out for Kojiro, only to be surprised when Kojiro handed him a wet potato in return.<br />
Kojiro smiled seeing the confusion on Ainosuke’s face. “Grab a paper towel and dry off the potato and then peel the skin off the potatoes,” he explained.<br />
Nodding, Ainosuke went to do as he was told, drying off the potato and then holding both the potato and peeler in his hand. He had seen Kojiro do this many times before, but it still seemed so intimidating. He looked over at Kojiro who was rinsing the other potatoes and setting them aside. Turning to Kojiro, he gave him an uncertain smile.<br />
Kojiro looked over at Ainosuke and saw the expression on his boyfriend’s face. He gave him an encouraging smile and turned off the water and dried off his hands before going over to Ainosuke. “Hold the potato like this,” he said, moving the potato so it was sitting long ways in Ainosuke’s hand. “And then take the peeler and place it on the top of the potato and drag it down.” He took Ainosuke’s other hand that was holding the peeler and dragged it down the potato, watching as the skin rolled through the blade.<br />
“Oh,” Ainosuke said, following the process that Kojiro just explained to him. A delighted smile spread across his face as another rolled up skin fell from the potato onto the counter. He continued this process until the potato was completely void of skin. He held it up to show Kojiro who clapped his hands.<br />
Splitting up the potatoes, Kojiro grabbed a knife and they worked on peeling the potatoes together. Once every potato was peeled, Kojiro grabbed out a large knife and cutting board before handing the knife to Ainosuke.<br />
Ainosuke looked at Kojiro with wide eyes and took the knife tentatively. He watched as Kojiro stood behind him, wrapping his arms around so he could place his hands over Ainosuke’s.<br />
“Hold the potato like this,” Kojiro said, moving Ainosuke’s hand into the right position, much like he did with the peeler. Ainosuke relaxed his hand and allowed Kojiro to show him the motions of cutting the potatoes into thin pieces. <br />
It didn’t take long for Ainosuke to catch on, following the motions that Kojiro’s hand showed him. He was slow with cutting and some of the potato slices came out thicker than others, but Kojiro reassured him that it was fine. <br />
“Next are the onions,” Kojiro then said as Ainosuke moved the sliced potatoes into a bowl. He watched as Kojiro grabbed a couple of paper towels and put them under the water. “This will help us cut the onions. They release a chemical that makes your eyes burn, but the moisture in the paper towel will help,” he explained.<br />
Ainosuke nodded and watched as Kojiro chopped the onion in half and started to slice it, as he had done with the potatoes. He handed the knife to Ainosuke when he was finished and watched as Ainosuke carefully sliced his half of the onion. He tucked his fingers in to prevent any accidents and sliced through the onion, much like Kojiro had shown him with the potato.<br />
When the onion was fully sliced, Kojiro then moved to the stove. He placed a pan on the burner and turned on the heat. He asked Ainosuke to drizzle the bottom with olive oil before adding the potatoes and onions. Ainosuke obliged per Kojiro’s instructions.<br />
“We want these to cook evenly so we’ll just occasionally stir them,” Kojiro explained. He stood back and watched while Ainosuke turned the potatoes and onions. It was about nine minutes later when everything started to boil. Kojiro then turned off the burner and took the pan off the stove and drained the oil.<br />
He instructed Ainosuke to grab a bowl and five eggs. After showing Ainosuke how to handle the first egg, he then requested he crack the rest of them into the bowl. Once Ainosuke was finished, Kojiro poured in the potatoes and onions.<br />
“Okay, so now we’re going to stir the eggs and potatoes together until they’re evenly mixed,” Kojiro explained, gesturing to the bowl. Ainosuke looked at the bowl and was a bit confused as to what exactly he needed to do. He then glanced up at Kojiro who gave him an encouraging smile before standing behind him. He wrapped his arms around Ainosuke and guided  his hand, showing him how to mix the potatoes together.<br />
Ainosuke relaxed into Kojiro’s chest and focused on the motion their arms were making as they mixed everything together. “Then we pour everything back in the pan?” he asked, turning to face Kojiro.<br />
Kojiro nodded. “You’re getting a hang of it.” He grinned, giving Ainosuke a kiss before moving out his way so he could pour the mixture into the pan. He watched as Ainosuke cautiously poured the mixture into the pan and turned on the burner.<br />
“You’ll want to take this spatula and run it along the edges so it can take form. And once they start to firm up on the sides and in the middle, we can flip it,” he explained.<br />
Ainosuke gave him a concerned look. “Flip it? Like you do the pancakes?” His eyes went wide as he tried to imagine flipping their bowl of vegetables like a pancake.<br />
Chuckling, Kojiro shook his head. “Not exactly. I’ll show you, and next time we make this, I’ll have you try,” he said.<br />
Smiling, Ainosuke wrapped his arm around Kojiro’s waist. “I like the sound of that,” he grinned, leaning into Kojiro’s side.<br />
While they waited for the food to cook, Kojiro helped Ainosuke prepare a salad and put a baguette into the oven to warm up. When the tortilla de patatas was finished cooking, Ainosuke carefully put it on a plate, while Kojiro watched.<br />
Ainosuke clapped his hands. “That was so much fun, but now for the real fun part.” He said with a grin, grabbing a pair of plates while Kojiro grabbed out the baguette. Ainosuke carefully cut the tortilla de patatas in half and prepared it on their plates alongside the salad and a piece of the baguette.<br />
Picking up his fork, Ainosuke hesitated in trying the food he had just made. He looked over at Kojiro who was already several bites into his meal.<br />
“This is incredible Ainosuke, you did a phenomenal job,” Kojiro praised.<br />
Rolling his eyes, Ainosuke scooped a piece of it up with his fork. “You helped me though,” he said.<br />
Kojiro leaned over and kissed Ainosuke’s cheek. “You did most of the work and you were learning. Now you know what to do, so next time you can do it on your own,” he said.<br />
With a deep sigh, Ainosuke took a bite of the tortilla de patatas and fell back into his chair. The taste was just as he remembered, sending him back to when he was just five years old and his mother would make it for breakfast. He scooped up another bite and let the nostalgia wash over him. 
“It’s...the same. It tastes exactly the same as when Mother made it,” he whispered.<br />
Kojiro was overjoyed upon seeing Ainosuke begin to devour his food and an enormous smile crept onto his face. Their first cooking venture together was a rousing success.<br />
Over the next month, Ainosuke had made tortilla de patatas several times for dinner, perfecting it and adding his own additions each time he cooked it.<br />
As Ainosuke was busy chopping potatoes, a pair of arms wrapped around his waist and a warmth pressed against his back.<br />
“Welcome home, my love.” Ainosuke turned his head to kiss Kojiro. <br />
Humming, Kojiro kissed him back and nuzzled his cheek. “I think you’re ready to learn how to make Spanish stew,” he said.<br />
Ainosuke’s face lit up. “Just in time for our trip!” he said, turning in Kojiro’s arms. <br />

Kojiro smiled and kissed Ainosuke. “I’ll get the ingredients on my way home tomorrow,” he said. <br />

“Perfect.” Ainosuke returned the kiss, hands on either side of Kojiro’s face before turning back to making their dinner.

    paragraphs: `Tadashi was, as they say, at the end of his rope. <br />

Ainosuke continued to perform well in his political life; he continued to endure the constant criticisms and fussing and matchmaking attempts from his aunts; he was even quite a bit nicer to Tadashi lately. And yet… he felt a great emptiness coming from Ainosuke.<br />

He hadn’t returned to S for six months.<br />

He had continued to ignore messages from Nanjo and Sakurayashiki. (Though, Tadashi noted, he did save them instead of deleting them.)<br />

He hadn’t displayed the sort of danger signposts that had led up to the nail-biting conclusion of the tournament, or to any of the dark spells of his youth. <br />

But something about this facade struck more hollow than anything previous, and even though Ainosuke hadn’t been so cruel with his words lately, he hadn’t exactly been warm, either. More than that, Tadashi knew his place—he hadn’t been the correct person to go against Ainosuke in the tournament, and the same instinct that had told Tadashi that was now tugging faintly at his heart.  <br />

Tadashi had spent years at Ainosuke’s side. He’d seen the cycle of a new “Eve” more times than he could count. But… Ainosuke had been so cheerful earlier that year, and then he had <em>changed.</em><br />

Perhaps this answer also lay outside his direct control, Tadashi thought. And so, he schemed.<br />

—<br />

Though this skate park didn’t truly belong to anyone, Langa had begun to think of it as theirs. His and Reki’s. Even though their friends joined them here once in a while, it was the place where Reki had taught him the most about skateboarding, where he nailed his first ollie… He sat on the bench, smiling at the ramps which might as well be old friends as well. Reki was next to him, showing him some videos that had come up in his ‘memories’—of course it was a lot of him bailing and eating concrete. They were both laughing so hard at the way he had once been barely able to stand on a skateboard that neither of them noticed the sound of a car or the approach of measured footsteps. Of course, these weren’t uncommon sounds for the area, so it was only so much white noise to their fun.<br />

Until a figure undeniably approached them on the bench. Even then, both of them expected Hiromi or maybe Kojiro, so the man before them in a tidy suit was a surprise. He looked familiar, but Langa couldn’t place him. Like that sense of seeing a teacher outside of school and not recognizing them at first.<br />

Reki pointed. “It’s you again!” he said. <br />

Langa blinked. “Oh,” he said, the pieces clicking together. “Snake, right?”<br />

The man nodded. “Pardon the interruption. I wanted to give you this.” He held out a card to Langa. Though it had the shape and feel of a business card, it was completely blank. When Langa turned it over, something was printed in tediously neat handwriting. <br />

“What is it?”  

Snake folded his hands behind his back. “His phone number.”<br />

It didn’t take three guesses for Langa or Reki to figure out who “he” was. <br />

Reki scoffed. “Adam wants to try a normal approach <em>now</em>?” <br />

Snake’s gaze slid briefly to Reki, hardly batting a single eyelash. “He has no hand in this. I came on my own.” <br />

“Why?” <br />

Snake shifted his weight a little. “Because he needs someone to talk to.” <br />

Reki pursed his lips. “What does that mean?” he wondered.<br />

Langa, who had been turning the card over in his hands, finally lifted his gaze back up towards Snake. “Thank you,” he said. “I was worried that he hadn’t been at S, even though everyone told me it was normal for him to be away…”<br />

Snake nodded. Mission accomplished, he turned as though to leave as quietly as he’d arrived. <br />

“Will you come back, too?” he asked.<br />

Snake stopped, turning only his head to give Langa a strange look. “What?”<br />

“Will you come back to S to race?” Langa said, worried he hadn’t been clear enough. He was pretty sure his Japanese had been getting better… “You were so fast in the elimination rounds, Cherry said that you beat the time Adam set on the sprint course. I’m a little disappointed I didn’t get to go against you in the tournament after all.”<br />

The older man seemed at a complete loss for words. “I… do not know.”<br />

Langa just smiled again. “Well, no pressure. But I still think it would be a lot of fun.”<br />

Snake tilted his head. “I see,” he said. And as though he could think of nothing else, he simply left the skate park.<br />

Reki scratched his head, frowning after Snake for a moment before turning his attention back to Langa. “Langa, are you really going to talk with Adam, then?” <br />

Langa shrugged as he tucked the card carefully into his pocket. “Sure,” he said. <br />

Reki sighed. “You’re so carefree.” <br />

That made Langa laugh. “Sure, sure,” he said. And then, because he wasn’t sure he could talk about how he missed Adam without turning the color of Reki’s hair, he nudged him with his elbow. “Hey, enough of this fail stuff anyway, where’s the video where I finally nailed that ollie?”<br />

“Oh duh, it’s right here,” Reki said, and immediately started scrolling through his phone. Langa leaned forward again to watch.<br />

—<br />

On the first night he was back in Tokyo for the next regular Diet session, Ainosuke had received a text from an unknown number. If the person on the other end hadn’t called him Adam, he might have ignored it. <br />

How terrible that would have been!<br />

He hadn’t expected this to be the start of a continued relationship with Langa. He hadn’t expected Langa to reach out to him at all, if he were honest. But he had living proof of it, and when he wasn’t attending committee meetings or reviewing propositions, he couldn’t stop scrolling through the already long thread of messages they had exchanged.<br />

Langa missed him. He spent a lot of time looking at this message in particular. Sometimes it made him want to leap on the next available flight to Naha. Tadashi, as usual, kept him a little more grounded to reality. He would be in Okinawa regularly enough, to check on his aunties; Tadashi could arrange meet-ups in a convenient manner.<br />

Even still, Ainosuke’s impatience was spectacular. Nevermind the dog comparisons—if Tadashi were a billy goat, his horns would have been worried off already. By the time of his first reunion with Langa, Tadashi appeared <em>exhausted</em>.<br />

Ainosuke had been too enthused to pay much attention. Seeing Langa again filled him with as much love and light as it had months ago. Langa seemed excited to show him the park; it was one of a few scattered through the city limits of Naha, but apparently Langa had done a lot of his learning about skateboarding here, so it was special to him.<br />

That Langa had foremost wanted to share this with him filled Ainosuke with a light, tingling feeling that he would forever struggle to describe. <br />

And then Langa smiled serenely up at him. “Wanna skate?”<br />

Ainosuke blinked. “I’d love to, but I—”<br />

“Ainosuke-sama.” Tadashi had lingered at the side of the park while he and Langa spoke. Now, resourceful as ever, he was offering Ainosuke a street board. Well, he supposed this could have been one of the details Tadashi and Langa had spoken about prior to this. <br />

Still, it seemed magical. He took the board from Tadashi, the moment weighed down by an air of reverence. Their eye contact felt so deep, like a physical touch, like they could gaze into each other’s eyes forever without blinking—<br />

“Tadashi, next time you should bring two so you can skate too,” Langa called. He was already playing on his own board again. <br />

The spell was broken. Tadashi dropped his gaze away, saying nothing to Langa. Ainosuke tossed the board down and hopped on. He went straight for one of the quarter pipes, shaking off the heavy moment with the heart-stirring feeling of gravity dropping away in a few moments of good air.<br />

They skated for half an hour that Ainosuke wished would stretch infinitely long, but of course it couldn’t. Just as he had facilitated it, Tadashi had to call it to a stop. <br />

Ainosuke would have to get on a plane that evening, of course. <br />

He smiled regretfully down at Langa. “Let’s arrange to meet when I’m back in town,” he said.<br />

Langa smiled, and then before Ainosuke knew what was happening, he stepped closer and pressed a sweet little kiss to his cheek. “It’s a date,” he said slyly, clearly pleased with himself, before going back to the quarter pipe to keep practicing a trick he’d been working on.<br />

Ainosuke was so stunned that Tadashi ended up having to pull him away by his wrist.<br />

—<br />

For the rest of that day, Ainosuke could barely stop touching his cheek. It was obvious, even if Tadashi weren’t looking for it. Everything was obvious: the way Ainosuke hummed more, the enthusiasm with which he checked his phone, the little trinkets he picked up wherever he happened to be which were, of course, intended as gifts when he saw Langa again. <br />

He didn’t wish to acknowledge the acrid feeling it all put in his gut.<br />

Because this was what he wanted. Tadashi had made Ainosuke happy, indirectly at least. (It was always indirect with him, wasn’t it?) Langa seemed very happy, too, so really who cared what the dog thought?<br />

This is what Tadashi told himself, anyway, as he woke Ainosuke up and fed him breakfast. As he took Ainosuke to and from meetings and lunches. As he arranged Ainosuke’s travel plans. As he coordinated on days and times with Langa. <br />

Tadashi sighed as he tapped his fingers on the steering wheel. He frowned at the store front of Dope Sketch. He couldn’t even be mad at Langa. Not only had he done nothing wrong, but Langa made a point to keep in touch with him, too. He’d even once asked Tadashi’s advice for college applications. <br />

That had thrown Tadashi for a loop. Why ask him?<br />

Ainosuke had gone to college in America and Langa figured there might be things about the process that neither his experience in Canada or Ainosuke’s in the States would help him with, or so the logic had gone. <br />

Tadashi did what he could to help. Langa wasn’t a terrible student, but he hadn’t settled on a focus for study yet. There, Tadashi wasn’t much use, and his stern words about skateboarding seemed to have dried up at this juncture where Langa should be building his path to the ‘real world’.<br />

Those words seemed to have dried up in general, but that was another thing Tadashi kept in a tidy little box to deal with at a later date. Langa would likely pay as much heed to them as his redhead friend, anyway.<br />

No, Langa was impossible to dislike. Every time he was together with Ainosuke and Langa, the young man asked him to skate. Even though the answer was always no, he still persisted, and gave him the same little smile before going back to join Ainosuke. <br />

And now, Tadashi was here. He hadn’t even protested when Ainosuke simply invited Langa to the Shindo estate. <br />

“Antsy, puppy?” <br />

Tadashi glanced up to meet Ainosuke’s gaze in the rear-view mirror before he realized he was still tapping the steering wheel. He stopped, still saying nothing.<br />

Lack of reply had never deterred Ainosuke before, so the other man simply kept going. “There’s no need. While the aunties are away, the boys will play,” he practically sing-songed. <br />

Tadashi still remained silent.<br />

“What is it, then? You don’t approve?”<br />

Tadashi squeezed the steering wheel. “Whether or not I approve doesn’t matter,” he stated, his voice as flat as ever. <br />

Ainosuke hummed softly. Tadashi felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle as if he were being stared at hard, but he didn’t look. “If you say so.” <br />

Silence filled the car again, broken only by the click of Ainosuke opening his cigarette case. <br />

What did that mean? Tadashi simply rolled down the window.<br />

—<br />

The first time he’d been invited to Adam’s property, Langa felt he should have been less shocked. There were plenty of signs at S that Adam came from wealth, but since Langa mostly remembered living in small but comfortable apartments (and many of his friends lived in the same if not modest family homes), it hadn’t occurred to him that the entire estate could be so… big. The size of the manor itself was impressive, but the surrounding grounds were incomprehensible. He felt like a foolish fish, unable to keep his mouth closed. Thankfully, Adam seemed to find it charming. Or, at the very least, he enjoyed showing off for Langa in any conceivable way.<br />

After the second or third time, Langa felt the same wonder, but he got used to it. He was curious about the mansion itself, but most of their time was spent in the garden.<br />

Langa had also learned that Adam’s name was Ainosuke. Months later, he still wasn’t used to that, but that seemed okay too; a special light shone in his eyes when Langa called him Adam. The way that look made his stomach jolt made Langa all the more eager to keep calling him Adam, even though he behaved in public and still called him Ainosuke when others could hear.<br />

Fortunately, as they were sitting at the lip of the drained pool on the Shindo estate, Langa felt no pressure to behave any certain way. “Adam,” he said.<br />

Ainosuke turned his head. “Yes?”<br />

Langa thought for a long moment. What had he intended to say? To express the fortune he felt that Adam had opened his life to him, trusted him, kept skating with him and doing so for the pure love of it — he wasn’t sure he knew of any words to say any of that. In Japanese or English. After a long pause, Langa simply smiled. “Thank you for always making time for me,” he settled on.<br />

Adam grinned, an expression that made Langa’s heart pound at the flash of a sharp canine it showed off. He slipped an arm around Langa’s shoulder like he’d hoped Adam would and pressed an affectionate kiss to Langa’s cheek. “Of course, my Langa-kun,” he practically purred. “I always have time for you.”<br />

Briefly, Langa had an amusing thought that while he often chatted directly with Ainosuke by text, it was a good thing that he usually arranged actual plans with Tadashi. He had the feeling that if it weren’t so, Ainosuke would disregard a good number of previous engagements to come skate with him.<br />

Behind them came a soft sigh—Tadashi. This reaction was all the confirmation Langa needed; it was only a little sigh, but from Tadashi it might as well be a long-suffering groan. Langa laughed softly and leaned in to kiss Ainosuke properly.<br />

Langa got to his feet, ready to get skating. He looked over his shoulder, fixing his smile towards Tadashi. “How about today?” he said. “Let’s skate!” <br />

Tadashi appeared to hesitate more than he had in the past. Hopeful, Langa turned towards him, but Tadashi’s gaze slid past Langa, over his shoulder. <br />

Ainosuke laughed behind him. “I can’t answer, pup,” he said. “Do you want to skate or not?”<br />

Langa glanced over his shoulder. “Well, more than that… Adam, you want to skate with him too, don’t you?”<br />

Adam blinked, his surprised gaze back on Langa. He glanced at Tadashi and then back towards the pool again. “Yes,” he finally admitted.<br />

Langa smiled and looked back at Tadashi again. “See?”<br />

Tadashi stood still for several moments. Just when Langa almost ventured something else, Tadashi simply turned and walked away in the direction of the manor. Langa gazed after him, wondering if he had been pushing too hard. <br />

Behind him came the sound of wheels on pavement, and then Ainosuke sighed. He stood poised at the lip of the pool, shaking his head. “Don’t worry yourself about him,” he said. “He is… like that.”<br />

Langa shrugged, walking back closer to the pool. “At first I was just disappointed I didn’t get to go against him in the tournament,” he admitted. “But I don’t know… he kind of seems sad when he just watches us, doesn’t he?”<br />

Ainosuke frowned. “I wouldn’t know.”<br />

Langa was quiet for a long moment. “Both of you used to skate together here, right?”<br />

Ainosuke looked at him, shocked. “As children, yes. Did he tell you that?” <br />

Langa shrugged. “I guessed. He mentioned he spent a lot of time here as a kid.”<br />

“...You’re strangely perceptive.” Ainosuke looked like he had a lot more questions, but before he could say anything else, measured footsteps came along the path leading to the pool. They both turned to see Tadashi had returned. <br />

He was holding a skateboard under his arm.<br />

Langa’s entire face lit up. “Oh good,” he said. “I thought I had chased you off.”<br />

Tadashi gazed between Langa’s cheerful expression and Ainosuke’s bemused face. “I also wanted to join,” he said. He seemed to be speaking directly to Ainosuke.<br />

Langa had rarely seen Ainosuke totally speechless, but he truly appeared overwhelmed. Finally, he turned back toward the empty pool, foot poised on his skateboard once more. “So come on,” he said, and rolled down into the bowl. <br />

Tadashi trotted forward, throwing his own board down to hop upon, as though he needed the running start in order not to lose his nerve. <br />

Laughing, Langa skated right into the pool to join them.<br />

—<br />

The sun had begun to set by the time the three of them decided to stop. Once again, Ainosuke sat at the edge of the drained pool, his legs dangling over the lip. Langa was at his side, and after only a moment of hesitation — Tadashi sat carefully on his other side. That had Ainosuke’s heart thudding in his chest with a little more than just the previous exertion of skating.<br />

None of them said much, but that didn’t appear to be necessary. For the moment they simply caught their breath and watched the fiery reds and oranges of the setting sun begin to melt into purples and deep blues. <br />

Finally, it was Tadashi who spoke. “I should return Langa to his home before it gets very late,” he said. <br />

Practical as ever. Ainosuke nearly pouted; he didn’t want either of them to leave his side. Sitting here with Langa and Tadashi on each shoulder, surrounded by the fragrant garden while night fell… Ainosuke struggled to think of any more perfect scenes he had experienced in his life.<br />

Langa sighed, as if he were in the grip of a similar reluctance. “He’s right. I promised to cook dinner for my mom tonight, so I shouldn’t keep her waiting.” <br />

Ainosuke smiled easily at him. “What a good son! I hope to taste Langa-kun’s cooking one day.”<br />

Langa flushed and nudged Ainosuke’s shoulder. “Don’t tease.”<br />

“I’m serious!”<br />

Shaking his head, Langa got to his feet. Ainosuke and Tadashi followed suit. The trek back to where Tadashi had parked didn’t take long, and Ainosuke would be hard put to say that he didn’t feel a similar excited chord in his stomach at the sight their skateboards made lined up in the trunk together.<br />

The drive to drop Langa off was by no means short, but Ainosuke felt like it went by far too quickly. All of his time with Langa seemed to disappear with much more swiftness than he would like, but the warmth of the atmosphere in the car particularly assuaged something in his chest. <br />

Both he and Tadashi got out of the car once they were parked, the trunk open so that Langa could retrieve his skateboard. Before he did, however, he pressed a sweet kiss to Ainosuke’s lips. Ainosuke smiled into the touch, brushing his fingertips through Langa’s soft hair before releasing him as Langa pulled away. He didn’t snap up his skateboard, however; when he turned he wrapped his arms around Tadashi. <br />

Even from where he was, Ainosuke could tell that Tadashi had frozen. It seemed to make no difference to Langa, who simply said, “Thank you for skating with us, I hope you will again next time. And thank you for the ride home.” He gathered his skateboard out of the trunk. “See you soon!”<br />

And then he was gone. Tadashi stared after him for a moment before turning back around, his hands poised on the trunk lid to shut it once more. <br />

Ainosuke stared at the boards sitting next to each other, feeling an odd smile curl onto his lips. “Hey, Tadashi.” <br />

Tadashi paused, glancing over at him. “Ainosuke-sama?”<br />

Ainosuke lifted his gaze to peer into Tadashi’s features. “Want to skate more when we get back?”<br />

Tadashi blinked at him, as though he couldn’t possibly have heard correctly. He was probably thinking of everything they had to do to be prepared for the next day. The trunk shut with a soft thunk, and Ainosuke was sure he detected a little smile on Tadashi’s lips as he turned back towards the driver’s side of the car. “Yes,” he said quietly. “I would like to.”<br />

Ainosuke felt like his broad grin could split his face in half.

    paragraphs:
      `Tadashi walked down the corridor that led to Ainosuke Shindo’s home office with soft, almost silent steps thanks to the plush carpet that muffled every tread of his hard-soled shoes. He held in his hands, a sheaf of paperwork, and wore on his face, an expression that was impossible to read. Had one been able to, though, it would have been one that spoke of mild irritation. ‘Ainosuke-sama,’ he murmured softly after two polite knocks on the door. ‘She is here again.’<br />
Ainosuke smiled at the news, as usual, what Tadashi found an irritation, Ainosuke found an amusement. This was a routine occurrence by now. Every evening, Tadashi dutifully reported the same thing, that the mansion was being watched. A small inconvenience like a yappy little police dog nipping at his heels was truly the least of Ainosuke’s concerns these days. If they had any evidence against him, they would have arrested him, and not sent Okinawa’s newest little police pup to hound him.<br />
‘Give her a warm welcome,’ Ainosuke announced decisively. Tadashi nodded dutifully, then left.<br />
Ainosuke, though he was facing at least another five hours trawling through dry and boring paperwork late into the night, followed by an early morning flight, was in a surprisingly good mood. The smile that played on his lips, perhaps a little too harsh to be truly kindly looking,had told Tadashi all he had needed to know of his master’s proclivities towards a cruel tenderness.  Ainosuke always liked playing with puppies. Though they might have the tendency to stick their noses in where they didn’t belong, they could be so delightfully amusing.<br />
-<br />
Kiriko shivered in her car. Of course the heating was broken in the ancient, rusting under the hood, undercover police vehicle. Though the Okinawan climate was often so pleasant, the nights could be bitingly cold. Still, she had a jacket and her almost starved need to prove her suspicions right to keep her warm. Determination was a fire that burned hot from within. Tonight it burned brighter than usual thanks to the off-hand remark by a fellow inspector.<br />
‘Kiriko, the chief will have your ass if he knows you’re still doing these unauthorised stake-outs,’ he had grumbled as she signed out the undercover car for the nth evening in a row.<br />
‘They’re not unauthorised,’ she snapped. ‘I’ve authorised them.’<br />
Granted, it was against proper protocol, something that the by-the-book Kiriko would never usually do, but when she had more than a little suspicion that Ainosuke Shindo had some cops in his back pocket, she trusted no one, only herself. To authorise stake-outs she had to get the prefectural chief’s approval and she’d have placed a bet on him bending to Shindo’s will like a flimsy reed in a storm.<br />
‘Don’t you have more important things at home?’<br />
God, that had rankled. Her job was everything. Home was a cramped apartment with a too small kitchen and an always cold shower, a bath that leaked from a hole she just couldn’t find, and neighbours on the brink of divorce who apparently were content that the whole complex could hear their every yelling fit.<br />
‘No,’ she said flatly, making it clear that was the end of any conversation, Her fellow inspector didn’t take the hint.<br />
‘Go to a bar, go on some dates,’ he suggested, like it was easy. Like men had ever been able to deal with her. She was stern. She was intense. She would probably have been happy to resign her life to spinsterhood with a cat, but her apartment didn’t allow pets, so she couldn’t even do that. And so what? She was dedicated. She was a dog with a bone. She was… being approached.<br />
Drawn from her irritated memory, Kiriko straightened her slouched position suspiciously. There was a man walking to the gate of the estate, approaching her at an unhurried pace. As he approached, she recognised him quickly. Tadashi Kikuchi. Ainosuke’s right hand man, secretary, and all around dogsbody. He had a mug in his hand when he approached, steam rose enticingly from it, showing the heat of the drink within and the freezing cold of the night outside. If only she could have gotten him to confide in her. That would never happen. She could tell the silent man was loyal to a fault. What secrets Tadashi would have been privy to?<br />
Kiriko wondered if Tadashi had come to tell her to move away. In reality, she would have no option but to leave when asked, but the very thought rankled. It didn’t matter if she seldom gleaned anything past the comings and goings of the eccentric Diet Politician. Keeping her watch outside like a disgruntled sentinel felt like she was doing <em>something.</em><br />
But it appeared her solidarity watch came to an end and the Shindo household was no longer keeping their pretences that they didn’t notice her lurking outside almost every evening. He tapped the window politely and she lowered the glass.<br />
‘I have prepared some coffee for you Kamata-san,’ Tadashi said, clearly feeling no need for a preamble.<br />
She looked at the coffee he held in his hand. It wasn’t the coffee she was accustomed to, that much she could tell, half-cold coffee in paper cups, cheap precinct coffee that was more unrecognisable sludge than fine beans. She could smell the rich aroma of the coffee through the lowered window. Suspicious she might have been, but Kiriko had accepted the coffee before she had realised it.<br />
‘Thank-you,’ she murmured, only to find that Tadashi had already turned on his heel and left. She furrowed her brow.<br />
<em>Was that all? They weren’t asking me to leave?</em><br />
She waited until Tadashi was out of sight before she took her first tentative sip. Infuriatingly, it was delicious, and turning on the overhead light, much to her aggravation, she found that her coffee even had a little heart powdered in chocolate on the top. She slurped it up, taking a little vindictive glee in the destruction of the carefully created heart.<br />
When it grew late, even with the caffeine in her system Kiriko was starting to feel the first pangs of exhaustion, and she knew she could remain no longer. She didn’t drive when excessively tired and whilst it was always tempting to pull an all-nighter, keeping her eyes firmly on the man she couldn’t trust as far as she could throw him, she was expected to work the next morning and she was sensible enough to know she couldn’t. She climbed out of the car, the coffee cup held confusedly in her hand, unsure what to do with it. Had it been a plate, perhaps she could have washed it and given it back on a later date. A coffee cup, she was not so sure, but it appeared that the Shindo household was more prepared than her as a maid soon scurried into view, collecting the cup with a dignified curtsy. Perplexed, Kiriko drove back to the precinct to drop off the car. All in all, her evening had been unremarkable but in the end, after months of late night stake outs, why was it that she felt like she was the one being watched?<br />
Driving back to her apartment, now in her own car, Kiriko wondered why Ainosuke would have ordered coffee to be brought out to her.<br />
<em>Was it a threat? A bribe I shouldn’t have accepted? Or worse, was it a continuation of that absolutely repulsive flirtation that he seems to be so fond of?</em><br />
She knew it had to have been his order. Tadashi didn’t do anything unprompted. He was often a little more than a puppet to his master’s whims.<br />
It was simply another mystery to add to the hundreds that she needed to unravel about Ainosuke Shindo.<br />
-<br />
It took four more evenings of interrupted stake-outs before Tadashi made her coffee just the way Kiriko liked it. It was unnerving, because she didn’t tell him her coffee preference, and there had to be a limit to how competent a right hand man could be.<br />
Bothered that Ainosuke seemed to have the upper hand, as he always did in this game they played, Kiriko decided that she had grown complacent in her time observing the Shindo mansion. She knew his schedule well, albeit with a few blank spots she couldn’t fill in, especially late at night when Tadashi took off in a sleek black car with tinted windows. She suspected strongly that Ainosuke was the passenger of that car and yet, when she followed trailing from a distance, she could tell that Tadashi was employing evasive manoeuvres to slip away. Where they disappeared to, she didn’t know, but they would return to the mansion late at night, gone far too long for the most clandestine of underground political meetings. <br />
Kiriko would have bet serious money on it being something to do with the prefectural chief’s decision to lessen police patrols around an unimpressive area of town. Despite all Kiriko’s research, all she could find in that area was an old abandoned mine that had been closed down for decades. Inspecting the outside of the mine had revealed tall, locked fences that even the most determined of urban explorers would have struggled to climb over. Ainosuke was a strange man to be sure, but Kiriko was certain that he wasn’t disappearing regularly down to the abandoned mine. He might get dust on that precious blue suit of his and throw a temper tantrum. The very thought made Kirkio chuckle.<br />
Well, she was determined that this was a mystery soon to be solved.<br />
Binoculars, the underutilised, overpriced frivolity she had bought when she had an ex who liked bird-watching, were the ace up her sleeve this evening. And she centred her attention on the room she had since worked out was Ainosuke’s office. She ground her teeth when she saw that he was looking back, sipping from a cup identical to hers. She couldn’t tell from this distance if it too had the sweet little heart powdered on in chocolate that she had secretly grown rather fond of, but the thought rankled. It was the confirmation that she hadn’t wanted. Ainosuke had demanded the coffee.<br />
He was looking in her direction, likely at her car. At this distance at least she knew he could not see her, thanks to the safety the night-time blanket of darkness provided.<br />
Eyes she knew to be a fiery red, were on her. Even with the binoculars, it was not enough to tell such detail, but those intense eyes stared at her from every report on her desk… and more than that.<br />
She had long since wondered why, in her dreams, she saw hypnotising red eyes.<br />
She wondered why she thought so often to that afternoon when she had met Ainosuke at the hotel. He had been there for a conference and had flirted with her so easily it had made her shiver like she was the fly in his spider’s web.<br />
She swallowed down what might very well have been an emotion she wasn’t ready to progress.<br />
<em>It’s dedication and nothing more, she thought firmly. I need to prove his corruption, to lock him away from me- no, from the public- forever.</em><br />
Kiriko’s instinct was never wrong. That was why she was so drawn to him. That was why his eyes, mocking and cunning, made her stern heart flutter.<br />
She dampened the thought, compartmentalising like a champion avoider, but every evening it grew harder and harder to do. He was worlds away in his opulent home, she in a car with no working heating and the smell of cheap aftershave from whoever had checked the car out last. This distance was good.<br />
She needed to keep her distance.<br />
-<br />
‘Kiriko, you’re on the detail,’ the chief grunted.<br />
‘Pardon? No thanks, I’ve got a dozen cases on my desk.’<br />
‘He asked for you specifically.’<br />
Kiriko gritted her teeth. If there was a polite way to say ‘<em>hell no, I wouldn’t get close to that slimy bastard with a ten foot barge-pole’</em>, she was yet to learn it.<br />
‘Ainosuke is one of the forefront young politicians in Okinawa and it is imperative he has a security detail on him at all times. There are important people here today too. We have to show our best faces.’<br />
Kiriko’s face was not her best and that was why she kept looking at the desk. Indeed, her face was furious. Every time she tried to keep her space, keep this game of cat and mouse to a professional distance, that spoiled little rich boy kept moving the line. She clenched her hands, with fine manicured nails, into a fist and smoothed out the scowl on her face.<br />
‘Of course, sir.’ She firmed her resolve. ‘It’d be my pleasure.’<br />
Pleasure it was not, for Ainosuke insisted that she be at his easy beck and all at any given moment. Where the other police officers in the detail were placed strategically around the room, she had specifically been ordered to follow him around like a faithful little dog. But bruised ego aside, this was a golden opportunity placed perfectly in her hands. Representative Takano was present, lingering in the crowd, mingling through the media and masses with a winning smile like he wasn’t weeks away from an arrest. She watched Ainouke’s every expression like a hawk, to see if it twisted, darkened at the presence of the other Representative, or if he donned that charming snake oil seller smile full of falseness and disingenuous charm. But it remained carefully schooled. Kiriko might even have been inclined to believe it if he hadn’t turned to her and winked playfully. She shuddered dramatically, a gesture that caused him to chuckle, the most genuine emotion she had seen from him. Strangely, it pleased her that she had managed to be the one to draw it from him.<br />
Though she tried to use the opportunity to work on his security detail to snoop around a little, unhappily she was glued to Ainosuke’s side like a disgruntled shadow all evening.<br />
Before the interview, when Ainosuke and the other representatives who would be interviewed that evening had retired to the green rooms provided. Kiriko had been drawn to heel like the obedient guard dog she had been ordered to be, and found herself in Ainosuke’s green room.<br />
He was neatening his hair, and frowning a little when he noticed a speck of something that looked like ink on his tie. He fetched a clean one from his briefcase. A briefcase with a pile of paperwork that he had shut once again before Kiriko could get a good look. She was caught peeking though and he smirked at the challenging look in her eyes. He pulled off his tie and handed it to her, unthinkingly she took it, then her expression grew thunderous.<br />
‘Do I look like your butler?’ She grumbled.<br />
Ainosuke pretended to muse, mull over the question like it was a fine wine.<br />
‘No you’re much more attractive,’ he decided.<br />
She spluttered something that she hoped was scathing.<br />
‘Have you no shame?’ She managed to balk.<br />
He seemed to muse once more.<br />
‘Not when it comes to love,’ and his grin had a hint of something that was heavy, perhaps even dark with implication. It thrilled her more than giving her a rising sense of danger. It was something that made her mind flash to exhilaration, adrenaline, excitement and fun.<br />
He fiddled with his tie, and then looked unhappily at the knot he had created, his attention finally away from her flustered expression. <br />
‘Come on rich boy,’ she grumbled, coaxing him to turn to her and let her correct his tie.<br />
He was so close, and he smelled heavenly. A cologne that Kiriko could tell was so out of her budget there was no way she would have been able to identify what it was, intoxicated her senses. Suddenly she realised, in the quiet of the room, that they were in a very intimate position. She stepped back half relieved, half reluctant that the momentary bubble of intimacy had burst.<br />
The door knocked, and Kiriko was glad she had stepped back seconds before, as a member of staff peeked their head around the door to retrieve Ainosuke. She dutifully followed him to the stage.<br />
‘Don’t miss me too much,’ he teased as he climbed the steps up to the stage.<br />
‘Oh, I won’t,’ she scowled.<br />
The smile Ainosuke wore was more genuine and winning than usual.<br />
If it took Kiriko’s breath away, she’d never have admitted it. <br />
-<br />
When the meeting was done, so was Kiriko’s role for the day. Ainosuke was whisked away by Tadashi in his sleek black car, having left the venue so quickly the hungry media couldn’t have gotten close to bothering him. Still, just because her work for the day was done, didn’t mean her passion project was. When Kiriko finished her work back at the station it was time for her to return to her familiar watchful spot observing the Shindo mansion.<br />
<em>Kikuchi-san is late with coffee this evening, </em>Kiriko mused as she checked the time on her phone. She had grown used to the late night pick-me-up courtesy of the silent man. She closed her eyes and sighed heavily, hoping that she could exhale any lingering tiredness in the action. She rolled her shoulders, straightened her posture, anything to keep her attentiveness up. It clearly was not successful when there was a rhythmic knock at her window.<br />
‘Evening, Kikuchi-san,’ she said hurriedly as she rolled down the window. She hoped he hadn’t seen her tiredness.<br />
‘Forgotten me already?’ A teasing voice cooed.<br />
Kiriko twisted her neck so quickly she could have gotten whiplash.<br />
Ainosuke grinned at her like the cat that got the cream, looking at her messy car with visible amusement. She knew it didn’t suit her neat clothes. Of all people she didn’t want <em>him</em> to see this side of her.<br />
She held her hand out for the mug he held somewhat petulantly. She glowered when he sipped her coffee before he passed it to her.<br />
‘It’s sweet,’ he remarked.<br />
‘So?’ she grumbled defensively.<br />
‘Wouldn’t you prefer to be inside, instead of out in this cold?’ He asked, leaning into the window, observing the car with a little disdain. His tone was like he had found a little stray dog, abandoned at the side of the road, and his eyes told her that it was all a game to him.<br />
She scowled and pulled back her hand from the coffee, refusing it in case it was a bribe, suddenly on her guard. She shivered- cursing that once again the only undercover vehicle was the one with the busted heating.<br />
‘I insist you come in, little inspector.’<br />
She narrowed her eyes as she weighed her options. Would she really turn down an opportunity such as this, if just to keep her own death grip on her pride? She looked suspiciously at Ainosuke's red eyes, so intriguing, so hypnotising.<br />
<em>Damn him,</em> she thought, as she pulled her sensible but all too thin blazer a little closer to her chilled frame.<br />
‘Just this once,’ she warned after a long silence.<br />
‘If that is your desire,’ Ainosuke chuckled. <br />
He opened the door dramatically and with a flourishing bow, and she hated that it made a mutinous bubble of laughter escape her lips. Ainosuke looked like he’d won a prize. Kiriko climbed from the car with the distinct feeling that with Ainosuke around, she’d always be out of her depth. He seemed determined to close that distance she had worked so hard to keep between them and curse her not-so-iron will, Kiriko was starting to suspect she wanted him to.<br />
The next day, the next day, the next day. When had it become a habit she drove up the pathway to Ainosuke’s mansion to be greeted by his maids, rather than staying around outside?<br />
Lurking from a distance had been safe, but being in Ainosuke’s home office was <em>fun.</em> He may have been just as secretive in person and every conversation was an irritating push and pull as Kiriko tried to extract information from the man whose entire career had been based on lying to people’s faces. She hated that she had come to enjoy these exchanges. <br />
Ainosuke did too, amazingly. <br />
He was used to opposition. He faced it at home, at S and at work. Kiriko was essentially dedicated to being deliberately contrary. More than once he wondered what it would take for her to meekly agree with him? <em>What would it take for her to break?</em> Countering her every suggestion, implication, quest for information had only served to impassion her further, determined her evermore to reach her goal of proving his guilt.<br />
Should he kiss her?<br />
Should he ruin her life?<br />
Either way, Ainosuke found both thoughts to be splendid fodder for his daydreams.<br />
‘You’d look so much more beautiful if you cried,’ Ainosuke murmured one chilly evening, where he and Kiriko sat warm by the fire. She started, then scowled.<br />
It wasn’t the same as being told she’d be so pretty if she smiled more and for some reason she felt that this was likely the most genuine the politician had ever been with her. Ainosuke’s smile was one of a tiger.<br />
‘I’d like to see you try to make me cry,’ she growled. There was the challenge in her eyes that told him this was not a joke. ‘I’m not that delicate.’<br />
Ainosuke chuckled, crossing his long legs, and steepling his fingers whilst his elbows rested on the arms of his chair.<br />
Now, this was a woman he’d love to love.<br />
He could push and pull, he could bend her but she wouldn’t break. He knew what he had to do.<br />
What he did all that he held dear.<br />
He had to test her.<br />
The smile playing on his lips made her scowl further, but it turned to shock when he leapt to his feet and pulled her along too, humming impassionedly and dragging her around the floor in a feverous dance that only he was a smooth dancer in. She kept his pace with clumsy, desperate steps and it only pleased him more and more that even in this, she could stay at his level, that she was determined to match his stride. His steps were overjoyed, and his heart was soaring.<br />
When he hummed to the end of the song, and dipped her low. It was only natural that he pressed his lips against hers, smiling even more when he felt her tentatively respond.<br />
He knew he was right.<br />
He knew this was something special.<br />
He helped her up once more, and pressed a soft kiss to her knuckles, the brushing of lips, amused that some of her signature red lipstick had transferred to his lips in the kiss.<br />
Ainosuke’s mind was made up. He would send her away. Far away. Tokyo perhaps. Somewhere he could watch her from a distance and see if she was as passionate and dedicated to her goals as he was. Would she claw her way back? Fight tooth and nail just to take him down?<br />
Oh his heart pounded with anticipation at the very thought, and his humming began anew.<br />
‘Tell me, Kiriko-chan,’ he grinned, singing her name far too playfully for her taste. ‘How do you approach a challenge? An obstacle in your path? Something looming over you?’<br />
Her eyes darkened, her expression serious.<br />
‘I never back down from a challenge,’ she said determinedly.<br />
He dipped his lips to hers once more, he couldn’t help it.<br />
‘Lovely. Oh, that’s so lovely.’ His grin was wide and his dreams already spiralled out before his very eyes.<br />
He’d like to see her try.<br />
He wanted to see her try.<br />
That way when she came back, he would know for sure that this is love.

      `Ainosuke stands in front of his full-length mirror, lost in thought. His hands rest against his chest but his tie sits unadjusted, waiting for him to drag himself back to the waking world. He knows the car is waiting for him downstairs, ready to whisk him and Langa off to Sia la Luce. It isn’t the first time he’s been this month, or even the second, but it’s been longer for Langa, and tonight, Langa’s word is law.<br /> 

A sharp knock on the door snaps him out of thoughts of nights long past, and he looks over. “Who is it?”<br />

“Me,” comes Langa’s muffled voice. He doesn’t wait for permission before walking in, resplendent in the grey suit Ainosuke gifted him for their anniversary this year. “Tadashi’s waiting,” he continues as he comes to stand behind Ainosuke. “Is everything all right?”<br />

Reaching up to cover Langa’s hand on his shoulder with one of his own, Ainosuke smiles. “Perfect.”<br />

It isn’t Langa’s place to understand the low fluttering in his stomach, the way his chest twists along with Langa’s lips. Nerves aren’t becoming of a person like Shindo Ainosuke; not even when it comes to love.<br /> 

He’s been looking forward to tonight for months now. Perhaps Langa remembers the significance of the date, perhaps he doesn’t. What truly matters is that Ainosuke himself is aware: five years ago today, Langa began to teach him what love is. At the time, he had no idea. But as he's shed the layers of shame and repression shielding him from true comfort, the feelings stirred up by their funeral beef have remained.<br />

He never wants to come so close to losing Langa again.<br />

Langa looks him up and down when he turns around. “You look nice,” he says, winding both arms around Ainosuke’s shoulders. “What’s the occasion?”<br />

Ainosuke taps Langa’s nose. “That’s for me to know and you to find out, darling. Are you ready?”<br />

“Mm, starving.” Langa leans in for a quick kiss before pulling Ainosuke toward the door. He winds their hands together as they make their way down to the car, and doesn’t let go even when they slide into the backseat.<br />

Tadashi meets Ainosuke’s gaze in the mirror, a hint of a smile gracing his lips before he turns his attention to the road. <em>He</em> knows. He’s the one that helped pick out the ring that weighs heavily in Ainosuke’s pocket and though it's been a long, rocky road back to the friendship they once had, Tadashi is the only other person Ainosuke could imagine entrusting with his plans.<br />

Kojiro, who meets them at the door, does not know. Kaoru, sitting at the bar with a ring of his own, does not know. None of the patrons who whisper about the politician and his partner know, and that’s exactly how Ainosuke wants it.<br />

He knows Langa expects a grand gesture when it comes to a proposal. He should—Ainosuke has never done anything by halves, and such an important occasion certainly doesn’t lend itself to half-assing an effort.<br />

But just as Langa taught him to love, Langa has also taught him patience. Langa has taught him that some of the best things in life are simple, and Ainosuke wants to show that he understands. The shift from grand gestures to these easy pleasures was gradual, but worthwhile, and it’s all he thinks about as Langa leans against him as they dig into their food.<br /> 

“You’re tense,” Langa mumbles around a mouthful of chicken.<br /> 

“Don’t worry about it, love,” Ainosuke says. “I’m all right.”<br />

Langa squints at him, but soon enough the siren call of his plate is too loud to ignore. Ainosuke makes idle conversation about everything from Langa’s day to the next event at S, and when they’re both finished, Kojiro beckons Ainosuke toward the back room while Kaoru snags Langa.<br /> 

“Common practice to bring your patrons into the storeroom?” Ainosuke asks.<br />

“Care to tell me why Tadashi sprung for a bottle of champagne for ‘a special occasion’?” Kojiro counters, and Ainosuke flushes crimson. <br />

“None of your business,” he says.<br />

“That a ring box in your pocket, or are you happy to see me?”<br />

“I will shut you down, Nanjo,” Ainosuke hisses, batting at Kojiro’s hand. “What do you want?”<br />

Kojiro laughs, loud and booming, but quiets soon enough as he hands Ainosuke a small, neatly wrapped box. “Langa’s favorite chocolates,” he says with a knowing smile. “I could’ve prepared you a special table if you would’ve told me.”<br />

“It’s not—I don’t...want that,” Ainosuke says. “I was going for simple.”<br />

“Uh huh,” Kojiro muses, arching a disbelieving brow as he offers his hand. “Good luck, man,” he says as they shake. “I’m happy for you.”<br />

“Thank you.” Ainosuke takes the chocolates and surreptitiously hands them off to Tadashi when Langa isn’t looking. He hopes their meal took long enough for Tadashi to prepare the starting block properly. Snaking his arm around Langa’s waist, he tugs him close. “Ready, darling?”<br />

“Where are we going?” Langa asks.<br />

“Somewhere a bit more private,” Ainosuke says. “What do you say, Snow—come away with me?”<br />

Langa looks up at him like he hung the stars in the sky before acquiescing, and then they’re off, away from prying eyes.<br /> 

Ainosuke fills the drive to Crazy Rock with inane chatter. It comes too easily these days: an offhand comment about the weather, pointing out something on the street, a joke to lighten the mood when Langa reaches for his hand again. Their fingers twine easily, and Ainosuke finds the words sticking on his tongue when Langa presses the full length of his body to Ainosuke’s.<br />

“I thought we didn’t have S tonight,” he says.<br />

“We don’t.”<br />

“Maintenance, then?” Langa rubs his thumb in small circles against the back of Ainosuke’s hand and sighs. “How long will it take?”<br />

“Only a few minutes,” Tadashi cuts in smoothly from the front seat, and Ainosuke is ready to snap at him before he follows up with, “My apologies. I neglected to report a broken gate the other day.”<br />

“Naughty dog,” Ainosuke says, more out of habit than any real anger. He turns to Langa and nuzzles into his cheek before seeking out his lips. This, too, was unthinkable years ago. Now, he doesn’t care who sees the way he cups Langa’s cheek, doesn’t care who sees the smile that breaks across both their faces when they part. <br />

He <em>revels</em> in it.<br />

They trade lazy banter and touches until Tadashi parks in front of the gates. Tadashi, it seems, has gone above and beyond—one of the gates has been clipped with bolt cutters and is bent inward as though someone was brave enough to risk their neck on it. “There may be more up there,” he tells them, tipping his head toward the long path up to the top. <br />

“Lovely,” Ainosuke says coolly. “No need to tag along, we’ll catalogue the damage.”<br />

“Yes, Ainosuke-sama.” Tadashi bows, shooting Ainosuke a thumbs up behind Langa’s back before returning to the car. <br />

“Ready, darling?” Ainosuke asks. He stands behind Langa and rests his chin on Langa’s shoulder, tipping their heads together. “Is this okay?”<br />

“We should’ve brought our boards,” Langa mumbles.<br /> 

“Mm, perhaps if we come this way again,” Ainosuke says. “Though not like last time…” He steps around to face Langa and looks down with a small, rueful smile. “I’d rather take you away to our bed, not a gurney.”<br />

“Please, there was no hospital involved last time,” Langa snorts.<br />

“Regardless—” Ainosuke tugs Langa forward, and they fall easily into step— “I won’t put you in danger like that again. If you’d like, we can look at making improvements to the course. New bridges, better fencing.”<br />

“An anniversary race?” Langa lights up from his head down to his toes. <br />

“Unless you’re planning on redoing the entire course by midnight, you’re going to miss the date,” Ainosuke teases. “Though I <em>have</em> seen you do the impossible~”<br />

“Have you?”<br />

The breeze picks up as they continue on. It takes several long seconds for Ainosuke to gather his thoughts on the matter, because how does one tell your lover that the impossible was loving you when no one else was able? There are no words to properly convey <em>You helped me become a better man</em>, because even those that come close are candles next to the roaring inferno inside his chest.<br /> 

“Yes,” is all he manages, and he hopes the way he squeezes an arm around Langa’s waist is enough to convey <em>I adore you.</em> <br />

Langa’s nose crinkles. “You’re being weird again. Seriously, you’re being so…”<br />

“Loving?”

“So <em>soft</em> about it.” Langa worms out from Ainosuke’s grip, only to push down on his shoulders and warn, “Brace yourself.”<br />

All the breath rushes out of Ainosuke as he catches Langa’s full weight on his back, lean arms and legs wrapping around him as Langa secures himself. “You’re <em>heavy</em>,” he half-complains. “If anything, you should be carrying me. I’m practically geriatric, Langa.”​​

“That only works on people who didn’t watch you working out this morning,” Langa teases, nibbling Ainosuke’s earlobe. “Tell me where we’re going.”<br />

“To the very top,” Ainosuke says. Part of him wishes Tadashi had shown him how he planned to set up the area, but the other larger part of him knows that whatever he’s put up will be exactly right. He’s trusted him for the rest of his life, and Tadashi knows this is more important than anything.<br />

He’ll have done his duty.​​<br />

The walk up is even more difficult with Langa on his back, but Ainosuke manages. He teases Langa about his eagerness when he begs to be let in on tonight’s secret, then flushes down into his chest when Langa nips his pulse in retaliation. When they make it up, though, Ainosuke’s chest swells.<br />

There are tiny lights strung up in the tree by the starting line, lending its dead branches a soft golden glow. At its base is a small blanket, and that's it. <br />

It's perfect.<br />

It isn’t about how beautiful the setting is, after all—what truly matters is the way Langa is looking at him, equally confused as he is endeared.<br />

“What’s going on?” he asks, brow furrowing.<br />

Ainosuke’s chest aches with the question in Langa’s voice. He hates seeing Langa unsure, and pulls the younger man into his arms to soothe both Langa and himself. “I wanted to say thank you,” he begins, a little shakily. “Five years ago, you handed me back my board. With it, you handed back the life I thought I lost long ago.”<br />

Langa burrows his face into Ainosuke’s chest with a quiet noise.<br />

“I was afraid, you know,” Ainosuke continues, carding his fingers through Langa’s windblown hair. The breeze around them picks up again as he lets out a low sigh. “During, and after.” He settles his arms on Langa’s shoulders, his chin atop Langa’s head. “I thought you’d hate me for nearly killing you.”<br />

“I agreed to it,” Langa protests.<br />

Ainosuke noses into his cheek, then silences him with a soft kiss. “Be that as it may,” he mumbles into Langa’s mouth, “I didn’t expect you to stick around.” He kisses Langa again, slow and steady until the fight bleeds out of Langa’s body. “I didn’t expect you to <em>want</em> me.”<br />

“How could I not?” Langa all but purrs as he tips his head into Ainosuke’s palm cradling his cheek. “You’re my complement.”<br />

“And you’re mine.” Ainosuke’s fingers begin to tremble when he pulls back to see Langa looking up at him, a self-satisfied smile cracking across his cheeks.<br />

There really isn't anyone like him. Ainosuke could search the world over and come back empty-handed; he wouldn’t want anyone else anyway. Langa is the rock on which Ainosuke finds his stability and in return, Ainosuke uses that stability to be a man worthy of Langa’s love. They’re not perfect; no one is. He’s still learning that that’s all right. But their bond is steadfast, their love consuming.<br />

He wants it forever.<br />

“Sit with me,” Ainosuke says. He wraps his hands around Langa’s and tugs him down to the blanket, sitting cross-legged as he lets his hands fall open, palm up. Langa’s hover above them, but his aren’t shaking. <br />

“You look like you’re about to be sick,” Langa says softly.<br />

Ainosuke feels it, too. His heart leaps in his throat as his fingers skim over the thin skin of Langa’s wrists, and he has to swallow down a nervous laugh. The whole business would be much easier if it were one of his usual affairs, done up like the celebration a proposal should be. Easier if he could hide behind loud colors and grand gestures.<br />

But Langa doesn’t want that, and he’s more important than any pageantry.<br />

“Do you ever think about what would have happened if we hadn’t raced that night?” Ainosuke asks. His gaze is still fixed on the backs of Langa’s hands. “If you had said no, or I’d been called away.”<br />

“Sometimes,” Langa says.<br />

“Things would have turned out much, much differently.”<br />

“I still would have found you.” It’s Langa tipping up Ainosuke’s chin this time, his finger cool as it taps the line of Ainosuke’s jaw. “You’re the one I’m meant to love.”<br />

“Am I?” Ainosuke says. He remains awed at how easy it is for Langa to fluster him with a simple sentence. Langa’s eyes track Ainosuke’s hand as he reaches for the small black box in his pocket. As he draws it out, Langa brings a hand up to cover his mouth. “Because I’ll love you for as long as you’ll let me.”<br />

Langa nods, unspeaking as he holds his free hand out, fingers splayed.<br />

“Is that a yes?” Ainosuke teases, even as he’s slipping the band onto Langa. “Skate with me forever, darling.”<br />

“Of course,” Langa says. He scrambles forward into Ainosuke’s lap, acting every bit an overeager puppy as he attempts to touch everywhere all at once. “I want to, yes, <em>yes</em>.” Grabbing Ainosuke’s face with both hands, he pulls him into a graceless kiss. It’s more teeth than not, and Ainosuke tumbles backwards from the force of it, but they’re both laughing when they come up for air. “Yes,” Langa says one last time, elbows planted on the blanket above Ainosuke’s shoulders, “I will skate with you forever. Or, for as long as we’re able. You were telling me how you’re ‘practically geriatric’...”<br />

Ainosuke plasters a hand over his chest, feigning offense. “Using my own words against me. I didn’t think you had any interest in playing at politics~”<br />

“Mmn, I’ll leave that to you,” Langa hums. He traces down the side of Ainosuke’s face, smiling fondly down as Ainosuke’s gaze flicks down to his lips, then back up. “I want to love you for a long time too, Ainosuke,” he continues. “I can’t wait to get started on forever."

    paragraphs: `<em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em><br />

Getting Langa’s attention was an art, and Adam had mastered it. He tossed tiny pebbles from the garden—small enough not to scratch the window, as he’d learned his lesson the first time. When the window opened, he knew to brace himself, to catch the skateboard and the backpack that would sail out the window. Patiently, he waited for Langa to follow.<br />

Well… <em>Langa</em> didn’t sail out the window. They’d tried that once before, when Adam had convinced Langa it was a good idea, and severely underestimated how much a boy two years younger than him could possibly weigh. No one had been seriously injured, but the fall hurt enough to keep them from ever trying it again. <br />

Instead, Langa climbed down the trellis with practiced ease while Adam kept a careful eye on him. Maybe Adam couldn’t catch him in a <em>jump,</em> but he could still cushion the impact if Langa slipped and fell. <br />

Thankfully, Langa made it to the ground safely, and Adam greeted him in English: “Good evening!” His conversational skills were mediocre at best, but now that he had a native-English-speaking friend, he was happy to practice… even if it mainly consisted of hellos and goodbyes.<br />

“Evening,” Langa said, taking his board from Adam before he switched to Japanese. “Where are we going?”<br />

“I told you, it’s a <em>surprise.</em>” Adam grinned. “And what kind of surprise would it be if I told you before we got there?”<br />

Langa shrugged. “I guess. But—” Adam interrupted him by grabbing his hand, and started running out towards the street. Without any further discussion, they hopped on their boards and soared off.<br />

Langa’s skating had improved a lot in the few months Adam had known him. At first, Langa acted like he’d never seen a skateboard in his life, but he picked it up much quicker than Adam himself had as a child. Now, he skated along the street with ease, managed a pretty decent ollie, and could <em>almost</em> boardslide without falling on his face. Almost.<br />

Most often, they went to the skate park just outside of town. But more recently, on one of the nights Langa couldn’t make it, Adam had done a bit of exploring. He’d found a new place to skate, a very <em>promising</em> place, and he wanted Langa to be the first to see it. The abandoned mine was much farther away from Langa’s house than their usual place, so they picked up some speed crouching behind cars along the way. Thankfully, they were only spotted once, and ducked away before the angry driver identified either of them.<br />

Langa didn’t ask any questions, not even when they veered off the highway to skate down a secluded dirt path. It was one of the many things that initially drew Adam to Langa; his eagerness for new things and his willingness to try them without fear made him a perfect skating partner.<br />

They stopped when they reached a chain-link fence, and Adam picked up his board to toss it over to the other side. “Just like the trellis, right?” he said with a grin as he started climbing. “Careful at the top, though. It’s kinda sharp.”<br />

Langa followed after him without a word, throwing his board over and scaling the fence. They had to fight their way through some bushes and trees, but eventually, they reached a clearing in the woods. The lights from the street were too far away to make any difference out there, but Adam knew it wouldn’t take long for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.<br />

“Where are we?” Langa was looking off to the side, where the dirt path continued, but Adam wasn’t sure how much he could actually <em>see.</em><br />

“I think it used to be a mine,” Adam replied. “But I’ve been keeping an eye on it, and I haven’t seen anyone around here. The path’s really good for skating.”<br />

“You skate it in the dark?” Langa asked. It wasn’t a refusal. No ‘I <em>won’t</em> skate in the dark.’ Just a question.<br />

“It’s fine once your eyes get used to it,” Adam assured. He tossed his board onto the ground and placed a foot on top of it. “What do you think? Are you in?”<br />

“Sure.”<br />

Adam still couldn’t see much, but he spotted Langa’s silhouette as he dropped his board and hopped on. He couldn’t even start a countdown because Langa was already off, speeding down the hill with no regard for where he was headed. And instead of stopping him, or protesting in any way, Adam went right after him.<br />

He passed Langa quickly, as he expected. He didn’t want to go <em>too</em> far ahead in case Langa lost his way, but he <em>also</em> wasn’t going to let him win. That would defeat the entire purpose of the race, after all.<br />

Adam knew the path pretty well after a few runs on his own, so he skated without a problem. It was all the more thrilling now that Langa was following close behind, and for a brief moment, he wondered if he’d have a real challenge here.<br />

...Until he saw a skateboard roll past him with no one riding it.<br />

“Langa?” Adam called out as he skidded to a stop, then kicked his board up into his hand. Sure enough, Langa was a few meters behind, sitting in the dirt and holding his leg to his chest. Adam ignored the board and ran back to meet him; they could always grab it later.<br />

“Does this mean I lost?” Langa asked, and a slight smile on his face gave Adam a bit of reassurance. He was sitting up, alert, and speaking, so it probably wasn’t anything serious.<br />

“That doesn’t matter right now,” Adam said, looking serious as he crouched beside Langa. “Are you okay?”<br />

“Yeah. I think I just twisted something in my leg.” Langa pulled his shoe off and lifted his pant leg, and Adam grabbed his phone to use the flashlight. He was no professional, but he’d seen his fair share of injuries, and there didn’t seem to be anything obviously wrong. Maybe Langa was fine.<br />

“Your ankle?” Adam asked, and Langa nodded. “Can you move it?”<br />

Langa rolled his ankle around and flinched. “Yeah. Just hurts.”<br />

“We should get you home to rest, then,” Adam said as he shoved his phone into his pocket. “You don’t wanna mess it up even more.”<br />

Langa frowned. “But we didn’t finish the race.”<br />

“We can have a rematch another time.” Adam snickered. “Maybe with some more lights, if I can figure out how to turn them on.”<br />

“I guess,” Langa muttered. He didn’t seem too happy about this development, but Adam wasn’t going to let that sway him. An untreated injury, even a minor one, might result in something far worse. He didn’t want to risk it.<br />

“I’m gonna get your board, okay? “Adam asked as he set his own board down beside Langa. “Sit tight.“<br />

While Adam jogged down the hill, he pulled out his phone to send a text. They needed a way to bring Langa home safely, and public transport was out of the question. Thankfully, he had other resources.<br />

He had to run further than he’d expected, but he eventually found Langa’s board tipped over against a rock. He thought it would be pretty impressive if he skated his way up the hill, but it was likely impossible, so he decided against it. Instead, he used his pent-up energy to run back to Langa and help him stand.<br />

Walking all the way to the street was unavoidable for Langa, unless Adam wanted to throw him over the fence… and that seemed counterproductive. So he tried his best to support Langa while he climbed over, pushing on the backs of his thighs to give him an extra boost. By the time they made it over, it was clear that Langa was in pain, so Adam was quick to stand by his side for support.<br />

“How are we gonna get home if I can’t skate?” Langa asked.<br />

“Oh, I have someone on the way,” Adam replied. “Don’t worry about it. Can your bag hold both our boards?”<br />

“Uh…” Langa looked over his shoulder. “Maybe. Why?”<br />

Adam didn’t answer. He just walked around to strap his own board in front of Langa’s, relieved to find that they both fit. Then, he crouched in front of Langa with his back facing him. “Alright. Hop on.”<br />

Langa didn’t question it; he climbed onto Adam’s back, wrapped his arms around his neck, and let the other boy lift him up off the ground. Between another teenager and two skateboards, it was a bit of a heavy load, but Adam knew he had a short walk to the street. Plus, it was worth it if he spared Langa some pain.<br />

By the time they made it out to the street, a familiar black car was waiting for them. Adam double-checked the window to make sure it was precisely who he’d been expecting before he opened the backseat and set Langa down inside.<br />

Tadashi didn’t speak a word throughout the ride, not even when Langa asked who he was. Adam simply explained that he was a friend willing to help them, and that was all Langa needed to know.<br />

Helping Langa into his bedroom wasn’t an easy feat, and probably hurt the boy a lot more than Adam would have liked, but they didn’t have any other options. With a lot of patience (and more support from Adam), Langa managed to climb the trellis and tumble onto his bed beside the window. Adam climbed up shortly after him, resting his arms on the windowsill to keep his balance.<br />

“You should put some ice on that,” Adam said while Langa took his shoe off to look at his ankle again. He didn’t see any bruising, but it was worth taking care of if Langa was in pain. “Do you want me to come in and grab some?”<br />

Langa shook his head. “It’s fine, I can get it later,” he said. Once he had his other shoe off, he tossed them both off the bed and sighed. “Thanks for showing me that place. It’s cool.”<br />

Adam raised an eyebrow. A smile crossed his face as he propped his elbows up on the windowsill to rest his chin in his hands. “You think so?” he asked.<br />

“Yeah. I had fun. We should go again.”<br />

“I’d like that, “Adam said. He gazed at Langa for a few seconds too long before he said, “I should probably get going. I’m sure you’re tired.”<br />

Langa nodded. “I’ll let you know when it stops hurting. But you can still come hang out if you want, even if we’re not skating.”<br />

Adam’s heart skipped a beat. They’d never hung out… without <em>skating</em> before. Did Langa really just want to spend time with him? To enjoy his company? “Okay,” Adam replied, feeling a little giddy all of a sudden. “Goodnight, Langa.”<br />

“Wait.”<br />

Adam froze, hands gripping the windowsill. “Huh? Is something wro—”<br />

Before Adam could finish his question, Langa leaned in and pressed a kiss to his cheek. Adam’s eyes went wide, his face turned beet red, and his brain felt like it was on standby mode while Langa pulled away.<br />

“Night,” Langa said.<br />

Adam blinked. “Ah… yes,” he said, and couldn’t stifle the little giggle that erupted from his throat. He started his way down the trellis, more than ready to get out of there so he didn’t embarrass himself further. “Goodnight. I’ll… see you next t—” He cut himself off with a yelp as his foot slipped, and he fell the rest of the way to the ground. He landed on his back, which knocked the wind out of him for a moment, but it didn’t seem like too bad of a fall otherwise. He was still conscious and breathing, so he’d be fine. Probably.<br />

Once his vision refocused, he saw Langa’s head sticking out the window. “Adam?”<br />

“I’m alright!” Adam assured, giggling again while he gave Langa a thumbs up. A fall was well worth the kiss he’d be thinking about for the next month.
